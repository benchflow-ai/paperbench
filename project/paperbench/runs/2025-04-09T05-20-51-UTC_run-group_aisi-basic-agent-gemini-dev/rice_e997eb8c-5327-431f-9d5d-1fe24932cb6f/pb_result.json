Specifically, I look for code that uses a gym (or gymnasium) interface to call something like gym.make(\"Hopper-v3\") (or a valid alternative version) and extract the observation and action space details so that experiments can run. This includes confirming that the environment\u2019s state and action spaces are correctly identified (especially important since Hopper\u2019s action space is continuous) and that the code provides functionality to reset and step through the environment. The code should not only reference the environment but also actually instantiate it (e.g., during training or testing routines).\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, the file \"src/state_mask.py\" contains a class called StateMaskExplainer. Inside its __init__ method, the code tries to create a temporary environment instance using the gymnasium interface:\n\u2003\u2003temp_env = gym.make(env_name)\nIt then extracts the state dimension via temp_env.observation_space.shape[0] and checks if the action space is discrete or continuous. For continuous spaces, it further assigns the action dimension and the low/high bounds. This is precisely the expected usage for a Hopper environment (e.g., \"Hopper-v3\" would have a Box action space). \n\nAdditionally, in the train() function of StateMaskExplainer, the method self._make_env() is defined to create and return a new environment instance via gym.make(self.env_name), which again demonstrates the capability to initialize an environment. \n\nAlthough the code is written in a generic way (using the provided env_name parameter), it means that if one supplies \"Hopper-v3\" as the environment name, the Hopper environment will be correctly instantiated. There is no specific hard-coded Hopper environment in the code, but the generic gym.make usage is consistent with using any valid MuJoCo Hopper version.\n\nThe rice_refiner.py file is empty, but for this criterion the code in state_mask.py already shows handling for environment setup.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submission meets the criterion because the provided code correctly uses gymnasium (gym.make) to initialize environments \u2013 including the Hopper environment when given \"Hopper-v3\" \u2013 and correctly retrieves the relevant observation and action space information necessary for running experiments.",

The submission includes a full implementation of the original StateMask explanation method (via the classes MaskNetwork and StateMaskExplainer) that meets the requirement of producing binary outputs (0 for critical steps) and integrates into a PPO-based training pipeline for retraining in MuJoCo environments.

It also defines methods such as train(), get_importance_scores(), and a save/load interface. The train() method uses PPO to update the networks as described.\n\u2022 Although there is no explicit switch or configuration parameter labeled \u201cOurs\u201d versus some alternative, the implementation in StateMaskExplainer clearly corresponds to the optimized (or \u201cOurs\u201d) version of the strategy described in the paper. It adds a bonus term (using the parameter alpha) and updates the network using PPO.\n\u2022 There is no direct mention in the code of the selfish mining environment per se, but the implementation is generic and by design compatible with any Gymnasium environment. When applied to the selfish mining environment, this same class can serve as the explanation method.\n\u2022 The file src/rice_refiner.py is empty; however, this file is not directly required by our criterion, which specifically concerns the StateMask explanation method, not the refinement module.\n\nOverall, the StateMaskExplainer class in src/state_mask.py meets the expectation for the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method for retraining, and its PPO-based training loop demonstrates the intended transformation of the mask network\u2019s optimization.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1. The submission includes a correct implementation of the \"Ours\" StateMask explanation method (in src/state_mask.py) that uses PPO for updating the mask network and provides an interface (StateMaskExplainer) which can be used as the explanation method during retraining in any environment, including the selfish mining environment.",

Even though the code is likely generic for multiple environments, for the network defence environment it should follow this convention.\n\n# Reality\nIn the provided file src/state_mask.py, the MaskNetwork class is defined to output logits for a binary decision, with a comment stating \u201c# Output logits for binary mask action (0=keep, 1=random)\u201d. The get_action_and_prob method returns the sampled action (mask action), its log probability, and the probability that the mask network outputs \u201c0\u201d (interpreted as the importance score). In the StateMaskExplainer\u2019s training loop, the code uses the mask action as follows:\n\u2003\u2003if mask_action == 0: actual_action = target_action  \n\u2003\u2003else: actual_action = self._select_random_action()  \nThis clearly implements the intended behavior: when the mask network outputs 0 (indicating a critical step), the agent uses the target action, and when it outputs 1 (non-critical), the action is randomized. Although the code is written in a generic manner for use with any environment, the implemented logic conforms to the paper\u2019s requirement for the network defence environment.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submission correctly implements a mask network where an output of 0 indicates a critical step (using the target policy\u2019s action) and an output of 1 triggers random action selection, exactly as specified by the criterion.",

Alternatively, if the authors reformulated this objective in terms of a PPO gradient update (as suggested by the paper\u2019s discussion about adding an \u03b1 bonus), the code should explain how this modified PPO update corresponds to minimizing this difference.

However, no part of the code directly computes or minimizes an absolute difference between \u03b7(\u03c0) and \u03b7(\ud835\udf0b\u0304). There is no explicit estimation of the returns for the unperturbed target policy (\u03b7(\u03c0)) versus the perturbed policy (\u03b7(\ud835\udf0b\u0304)), nor is there a loss term that implements J(\u03b8)=min |\u03b7(\u03c0)\u2013\u03b7(\ud835\udf0b\u0304)|.

Although there is no explicit selection mechanism (e.g. a flag specific to the network defense environment), the provided implementation is generic and, if integrated into the network defense environment setup, would serve as the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method. (Note that the rice_refiner.py file is empty, but the criterion here is solely about the explanation module for generating rollouts without training.)\n\n# Score\nI award a score of 1.

I would expect that the implementation directly opts to evaluate or incorporate this performance difference into the loss (or its reformulated equivalent) when training the mask network. Essentially, I will look for code that computes or \u201capproximates\u201d the performance difference between \u03c0 and \ud835\udf0b\u0304, rather than just a generic PPO loss, and that this computation is used as the optimization criterion in the autonomous driving setting.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission provides a file \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d which includes a MaskNetwork, a PPO_MaskTrainer, and a StateMaskExplainer that implements the training loop for the mask network.

Instead, the submission relies on the PPO surrogate loss (combined with a bonus term for blinding) to train the mask network. There is no calculation of the performance difference between the target policy \u03c0 and the perturbed policy \ud835\udf0b\u0304 (for instance, by measuring returns or explicitly computing the absolute difference in expected rewards). Moreover, the autonomous driving environment is not treated in any special way in this implementation; the code is generic for any gym environment. Also, the file \u201csrc/rice_refiner.py\u201d is empty, so nothing there supplements the explanation mechanism. Thus, the specific requirement that the mask network objective should match J(\u03b8)=min |\u03b7(\u03c0) \u2013 \u03b7(\ud835\udf0b\u0304)| in the autonomous driving setup is not directly implemented in or evident from the submitted code.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0.

The following are the key points relevant to the criterion:\n- In the StateMaskExplainer class (at the end of the file), within the train() method, the code obtains a \u201cmask action\u201d from the mask network and then sets the \u201cmodified_reward\u201d as reward + self.alpha * mask_action. This is exactly the bonus-added reward signal described in the paper.\n- The modified reward is stored in a RolloutBuffer and later used within the PPO_MaskTrainer.update() method. This trainer computes advantages via generalized advantage estimation using the modified rewards, and then performs standard PPO updates.\n- The PPO update loop (in PPO_MaskTrainer.update()) computes a clipped surrogate loss and updates the mask network along with a value network. Although the code does not have an explicit line stating \u201cJ(\u03b8)=max\u202f\u03b7(\u03c0\u0304)\u201d, the process (using the augmented reward in PPO training) fulfills that requirement.\n- The implementation is generic (i.e. it is not hard-coded solely for autonomous driving); however, since the paper\u2019s approach is black-box and architecture-independent, this generic implementation is acceptable as long as it is used in the autonomous driving environment setup (presumably when target_policy and environment parameters appropriate for autonomous driving are provided).\n\nThus, the code does implement the objective transformation by modifying the reward and applying PPO to maximize the perturbed policy\u2019s return, which is equivalent to maximizing \u03b7(\u03c0\u0304).\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1.

This method should involve first using the mask network to identify critical states from the agent\u2019s trajectory (via its importance scores) and then resetting the environment to one of these identified critical states to continue training the target policy from that point.

In the expected implementation, after identifying the critical states via the mask network, the environment should be reset to at least one of these critical states, and then the training/fine-tuning of the target policy should resume from that state.

In the paper, during refinement the DRL agent\u2019s performance improvement is measured by tracking the cumulative reward (or episode return) over time. Therefore, a correct implementation would include a training loop (or refinement loop) which, on every episode or a fixed interval of steps, accumulates the total reward for that episode and logs or stores these values. In our context, I expect this functionality to be present either within a dedicated refining module (e.g., in a file like rice_refiner.py) or integrated with the explanation method code such that when the \"Ours\" explanation method is used during refinement, the implementation reports cumulative rewards by summing rewards across timesteps and possibly printing/logging them for later analysis.\n\n# Reality\nIn the provided submission, there are two files: \"src/state_mask.py\" and \"src/rice_refiner.py\". Within \"src/state_mask.py\", we see a full implementation of a mask network and a StateMaskExplainer class. Its \"train\" method maintains variables such as \"current_ep_reward_orig\" and \"current_ep_reward_masked\" for each episode, appends them to lists (\"episode_rewards_orig\" and \"episode_rewards_masked\") and prints out average reward statistics every log_interval episodes. This shows that cumulative rewards (per episode) are being measured during the training of the mask network. \n\nHowever, the criterion specifically refers to \"measuring cumulative reward throughout refinement\" for the MuJoCo environments using the \"Ours\" explanation method. In the context of the RICE paper, refinement refers to the process by which the pre-trained DRL agent is further improved using the explanations (i.e., by restarting from selected critical states and encouraging exploration), and cumulative reward across these refinement iterations is the key performance metric. The file \"src/rice_refiner.py\" appears intended for implementing this refining process, but notably it is completely empty. This means that there is no code for the refinement stage, nor any code that measures cumulative reward during that phase.\n\nThus, although \"src/state_mask.py\" does include code that logs cumulative rewards, it is tied to the training of the mask network (i.e. the explanation method) and not clearly to the refinement process as required by the criterion. The intended refinement component (and corresponding cumulative reward measurement) is missing.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0  \nThe submission does not meet the criterion because there is no implemented code for measuring cumulative reward throughout the refinement process for the MuJoCo environments using the \"Ours\" explanation method\u2014specifically, the refinement module (rice_refiner.py) is empty, and the existing cumulative reward logging in state_mask.py pertains only to mask network training rather than the refinement phase.",

In our context, refinement should be distinct from merely training the explanation network; it should involve running episodes in the autonomous driving environment with the agent using the \"Ours\" explanation method (i.e., the mask network providing critical-state guidance) and computing the cumulative rewards each episode, likely aggregating these over time to report an overall refinement performance trend.\n\nSpecifically, I will look for:\n- Code that runs the refined policy in the autonomous driving environment.\n- A mechanism (such as logging, storing in a list, or printing) that records the cumulative (total) reward per episode during the refinement phase.\n- References in the code (or in the logs) showing that this process is applied to the autonomous driving environment and corresponds to using the \"Ours\" explanation method.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission contains two files.

While this demonstrates that the code is measuring episode-level reward during the training of the mask network (the explanation method), it does not appear to be designed for measuring cumulative reward throughout the \"refinement\" process.\n\nNotably, the second file \"src/rice_refiner.py\" is entirely empty. According to the paper, the refining process is a crucial part of the overall approach\u2014especially for environments like autonomous driving\u2014but here there is no implementation provided that executes a refinement procedure or measures cumulative rewards from it. There is no code specific to the autonomous driving environment that runs the agent in the refinement phase and accumulates or logs cumulative rewards over episodes.\n\nThus, although the state_mask.py file tracks rewards related to the mask network training, it does not meet the criterion for measuring cumulative reward during the refinement process in the autonomous driving context using the \"Ours\" explanation method.

Since the criterion requires that reward measurement is implemented \u201cthroughout pretraining and refinement,\u201d the absence of any code in the rice_refiner.py (which presumably was meant to handle the refinement phase) indicates that no reward logging or measurement has been implemented for the refinement phase. Moreover, there is also no apparent separate module that logs or reports target agent \u201cpretraining\u201d rewards (beyond the StateMaskExplainer which is more focused on training the explanation mask). \n\nThus, while the StateMask module does include mechanisms for recording and printing reward values, the code that should handle reward measurement during the refinement phase (and possibly during the pretraining phase of the target agent) is either missing or not implemented.\n\n# Score\nI assign a score of 0.

In practice, this could be implemented by maintaining variables or arrays that accumulate per\\u2010episode (and perhaps per-step) reward values, and then outputting the average or cumulative rewards at regular intervals. In particular, I would expect separate measurement and logging for both the \\u201coriginal\\u201d (or \\u201cpretraining\\u201d) performance as well as the \\u201crefined\\u201d performance over time, corresponding to what the paper describes. Additionally, if there is a separate refinement module (e.g. in rice_refiner.py), it should incorporate reward measurement code to verify that the refined agent is improving compared to the original.\\n\\n# Reality\\nThe submitted code in src/state_mask.py contains a fairly complete implementation of the StateMask explanation training. In the StateMaskExplainer.train() method, there are clearly variables (\\u201cepisode_rewards_orig\\u201d and \\u201cepisode_rewards_masked\\u201d) that accumulate the environment rewards (the original reward from the environment and the modified reward including the mask bonus). The code then logs these average rewards at a defined interval (every log_interval episodes). This part meets the expectation regarding tracking and reporting rewards during a training loop. \\n\\nHowever, the submission also includes a file src/rice_refiner.py which is completely empty. Since the criterion requires that reward measurement is implemented \\u201cthroughout pretraining and refinement,\\u201d the absence of any code in the rice_refiner.py (which presumably was meant to handle the refinement phase) indicates that no reward logging or measurement has been implemented for the refinement phase. Moreover, there is also no apparent separate module that logs or reports target agent \\u201cpretraining\\u201d rewards (beyond the StateMaskExplainer which is more focused on training the explanation mask). \\n\\nThus, while the StateMask module does include mechanisms for recording and printing reward values, the code that should handle reward measurement during the refinement phase (and possibly during the pretraining phase of the target agent) is either missing or not implemented.\\n\\n# Score\\nI assign a score of 0. Although the StateMaskExplainer code shows some reward logging during its training loop, the overall submission does not implement reward measurement for the refinement phase (nor clearly for pretraining) as required by the criterion.
