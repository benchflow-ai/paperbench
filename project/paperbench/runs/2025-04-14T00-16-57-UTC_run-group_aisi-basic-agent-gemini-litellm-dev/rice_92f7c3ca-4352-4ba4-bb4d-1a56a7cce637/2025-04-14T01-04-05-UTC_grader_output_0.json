Additionally, if the experiment requires getting and setting states (e.g. for fidelity scoring or resetting to a critical state), there should be helper functions checking for \u201cget_state\u201d and \u201cset_state\u201d capabilities (as described in Appendix C.2). In summary, the code should correctly create, wrap, and work with the Hopper environment so that it can be used in the experiments.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, several files address environment initialization:\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/fidelity.py\u201d, the function calculate_fidelity_score uses gym.make(env_id) and the main block sets ENV_ID = \"Hopper-v3\". The code also defines helper functions get_env_state and set_env_state that check for and use \u201cget_state\u201d/\u201cset_state\u201d, which is expected for a MuJoCo environment.\n\u2022 In \u201cscripts/train_pretrained.py\u201d, the code calls make_vec_env(env_id, ...) using \"Hopper-v3\" as the default environment, showing that the environment is correctly created.\n\u2022 In \u201cbaselines.py\u201d and \u201cscripts/run_fidelity.py\u201d, references to \u201cHopper-v3\u201d are used consistently.\nThese pieces confirm that the submission is using the proper identifier for the Hopper environment and is applying the Stable Baselines3 wrappers (e.g. DummyVecEnv) to support parallel execution, which aligns with expected practice for running experiments.\n\n# Score\nI assign a score of 1.

The comments and examples in these scripts indicate that the intended environment is Hopper-v3.\n- Similarly, **scripts/run_fidelity.py**, **scripts/train_mask.py**, and **scripts/run_refinement.py** emphasize the use of Hopper-v3 either by default or through command-line parameters.\nThese occurrences show that the code consistently sets up the Hopper environment using \"Hopper-v3\" and that the implementation adheres to the expected version of the MuJoCo Hopper environment.\n\n# Score\n1\n\nThe submission correctly implements the use of the (MuJoCo) Hopper environment with version \"Hopper-v3\" as required by the criterion.

The same generic calls are used in run_hyperparams.py, run_refinement.py, and other scripts.\n- There is no special-case code that would interfere with the initialization of Walker2d-v3, and there are no indications in the submission that Walker2d was omitted or incorrectly implemented.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1.

In practice, this means that any code creating or configuring the Walker2d environment should call gym.make() or make_vec_env() with the environment id \"Walker2d-v3\". Moreover, any defaults (such as D_max values or refinement hyperparameters) that depend on the environment should include an entry keyed by \"Walker2d-v3\". In short, the correct resolution would show that if the user chooses the Walker2d environment, then the appropriate version string \"Walker2d-v3\" is used throughout the code.\n\n# Reality\nExamining the submission files reveals the following:\n- In \"scripts/run_hyperparams.py\", a DEFAULT_D_MAX dictionary is defined:\n  \u2022\u2003\"DEFAULT_D_MAX = { \"Hopper-v3\": 3600.0, \"Walker2d-v3\": 4000.0, \"Reacher-v2\": 20.0, ... }\"\n  This explicitly includes \"Walker2d-v3\" with a D_max value of 4000.0, which confirms that the intended version is supported.\n- In \"scripts/run_refinement.py\", we see that the DEFAULT_RICE_PARAMS dictionary also includes:\n  \u2022\u2003\"Walker2d-v3\": {\"p_critical\": 0.25, \"lambda_intrinsic\": 0.01}\n  This again shows that when the Walker2d environment is chosen, the correct version string \"Walker2d-v3\" is referenced.\n- Throughout the code (in files such as \u201ctrain_pretrained.py\u201d, \u201cbaselines.py\u201d, and others) the environments are created by passing the environment id (via gym.make or make_vec_env). Although some default values for the environment are set to \"Hopper-v3\", the code is written to accept any string passed through the command-line argument. Thus, if the user provides \"Walker2d-v3\" when running experiments, the code will correctly initialize that environment.\n  \nOverall, the submission does not hard code Walker2d-v3 everywhere; instead it uses user-specified env id (with defaults present in some scripts) and it explicitly has entries keyed by \"Walker2d-v3\" in its configuration dictionaries. This is consistent with expected behavior.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1 for this criterion because the submission clearly supports the Walker2d environment via the explicit use of the version string \"Walker2d-v3\" (as seen in the DEFAULT_D_MAX and DEFAULT_RICE_PARAMS dictionaries) and the environment creation calls are parameterized to accept this value.",

Notably, the default D_max dictionary in \u201cscripts/run_fidelity.py\u201d includes an entry for \"Reacher-v2\" (set to 20.0), which indicates that the authors have explicitly considered the Reacher environment for their experiments.

We do not require custom modifications since the paper directs using generic RL agent architectures.

This indicates that the author anticipates running fidelity evaluations on the HalfCheetah-v3 environment.\n\u2022 In scripts/train_pretrained.py and in baselines.py, the code creates environments using make_vec_env(env_id, ...). This mechanism will work for any valid gymnasium environment; thus, if \"HalfCheetah-v3\" is used, it will be correctly initialized.\n\u2022 Additionally, in scripts/run_refinement.py the same procedure is followed. The code does not hardcode specific parameters unique to HalfCheetah but is set up generically such that providing \"HalfCheetah-v3\" as the env id will work.\nOverall, the submission relies on stable and generic methods (gym.make, make_vec_env) to instantiate environments. The use of a predefined D_max for \"HalfCheetah-v3\" further implies that the authors intended the HalfCheetah environment to be part of the experiments. While no file demonstrates an explicit test run of HalfCheetah, the infrastructure supports any version, and the provided defaults include the relevant entry.\n\n# Score\n1  \nThe submission meets the criterion for correctly setting up and initializing a version of the (MuJoCo) HalfCheetah environment.

In a correct implementation, I would expect the reproduction code to explicitly incorporate an observation\u2010normalization step in the training pipeline for HalfCheetah. For example, this could be done by wrapping the environment with a standard normalization wrapper (such as Stable Baselines3\u2019s VecNormalize) or by implementing a custom normalization module that computes a running mean and standard deviation and normalizes observations before they are passed to the policy. When reviewing the code, I would look for the use of such a normalization wrapper or for explicit handling of the observation normalization (e.g., functions that subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) that is applied to the observations used for learning the agent\u2019s policy.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission includes multiple files covering different components (fidelity, RND, baselines, RICE, state_mask, and several scripts). Regarding observation normalization for the HalfCheetah environment:\n- In \"src/rnd.py\", a class called RNDObservationNormalizer is implemented. This module does perform normalization on a tensor of observations by subtracting a running mean and dividing by a running standard deviation, with clipping applied afterward.\n- In \"src/rice.py\", within the \u201ctrain_rice\u201d function the code instantiates an RNDObservationNormalizer and uses it in the RNDRewardWrapper. In the RNDRewardWrapper\u2019s step_wait method, the observations from the environment are converted to a tensor and then passed through the obs_normalizer to compute \u201cnormalized_next_obs\u201d for the purpose of computing intrinsic rewards.\n- However, critically, after normalization is performed internally for computing the RND intrinsic reward, the wrapper then returns the original unmodified observations (i.e. it returns \u201cobs\u201d rather than the normalized output). This means that while the RND module is using normalized observations for its internal loss computation, the DRL agent itself receives the raw, unnormalized observations.\n- In other parts of the submission (e.g. in the training scripts like \"train_pretrained.py\" or how the environment is created in baselines), there is no evidence of using a normalization wrapper (such as VecNormalize) or similar mechanism that would normalize the observations before they are fed into the DRL agent\u2019s policy.\n  \nThus, while there is code that implements observation normalization (in the context of RND processing), there is no code that actually normalizes the observations that the DRL agent receives when training on HalfCheetah\u2014contrary to the requirement in the paper.\n\n# Score\n0 \u2013 The submission does not meet the criterion. Although an observation normalization module is implemented for computing intrinsic rewards (RNDObservationNormalizer), the normalized observations are not passed to the DRL agent during training in the HalfCheetah environment. There is no evidence of a normalization wrapper (such as VecNormalize) being applied so that the agent\u2019s inputs are normalized, and therefore the criterion is not satisfied.",

In practice, many reproductions simply rely on the gymnasium interface (using gym.make or make_vec_env) and assume that if a \u201csparse\u201d version of the environment is registered (for example as \u201cSparseHopper-v0\u201d), then the existing generic environment\u2010initialization code will correctly instantiate it. Therefore, a correct resolution should include code that calls gym.make(env_id) or make_vec_env with the environment id as a parameter. In our evaluation we will check that the submission\u2019s code uses these calls so that if a user passes in a sparse hopper environment id (or if the sparse variant is available in the gym registry), the environment initializes properly without additional hardcoding and that functions (e.g. those retrieving and setting the environment state) are compatible with MuJoCo tasks.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission\u2019s files (e.g. in src/fidelity.py, baselines.py, rice.py, and various scripts) repeatedly use generic environment initialization via gym.make(env_id) or make_vec_env(env_id, ...). For example:\n\u2022 In src/fidelity.py, the function calculate_fidelity_score begins with \u201cenv = gym.make(env_id)\u201d. Similarly, in baselines.py and rice.py, the code calls \u201cmake_vec_env(env_id, ...)\u201d to create vectorized environments.\n\u2022 The code also defines helper functions get_env_state and set_env_state to work with MuJoCo state (qpos and qvel), which suggests it is intended for MuJoCo-based environments.\n\u2022 The default environment id used in many examples is \"Hopper-v3\". While \"Hopper-v3\" is normally the dense variant, the code does not hard-code any specific reward\u2010modification logic, meaning it is generic.\n\u2022 The submission does not include an explicit wrapper that modifies the reward to be sparse; however, it is designed to work with any environment id provided by the user. This means that if a sparse version of the Hopper environment (for example, \"SparseHopper-v0\") is registered in gym, the function gym.make(env_id) will correctly initialize it.\nThus, compared to our expectation, although there is no explicit \u201csparse hopper wrapper\u201d in the code, the submission provides generic and flexible environment initialization which meets the criterion of \u201cany version\u201d of the Sparse Hopper environment being correctly set up and initialized.\n\n# Score\n1\n\nThe submission meets the criterion since it correctly implements generic initialization of MuJoCo environments via gym.make/make_vec_env. This approach allows any environment\u2014for example, a Sparse Hopper environment\u2014to be set up and run provided the appropriate environment id is supplied.",

In other words, any code setting up or referencing the sparse HalfCheetah environment should use \"HalfCheetah-v3\" as the environment name. I will look in the code (especially in any parts that define default parameters or call gym.make) to see that \u201cHalfCheetah-v3\u201d is explicitly mentioned (or is used via default parameters) for the sparse HalfCheetah experiments. I do not expect any hard-coded environment names that deviate from this version.\n\n# Reality\nIn the provided submission files, I inspected several files that handle environment creation or define default settings:\n- In \"scripts/run_hyperparams.py\", there is a dictionary named DEFAULT_D_MAX in which \u201cHalfCheetah-v3\u201d is explicitly included with a value of 2200.0. This indicates that the authors expect the sparse HalfCheetah experiments to run on the environment version \"HalfCheetah-v3\".\n- Similarly, in \"scripts/run_fidelity.py\", the DEFAULT_D_MAX dictionary again includes the key \"HalfCheetah-v3\".\n- In the training and refinement scripts (e.g., \"scripts/train_pretrained.py\" and \"scripts/run_refinement.py\"), the environment id is taken from the argument (args.env) and the defaults are set such that when one provides \"--env HalfCheetah-v3\", the code will correctly create that environment via gym.make.\n- Although \"src/fidelity.py\" in its example uses \"Hopper-v3\", the overall submission supports multiple environments via command-line arguments and default dictionaries, including \"HalfCheetah-v3\".\n\nThus, the submission supports and correctly expects that the Sparse HalfCheetah environment is specified as \"HalfCheetah-v3\" through its configuration, and it is present in the default settings.\n\n# Score\n1. The submission meets the criterion because the default configuration dictionaries and code clearly include \"HalfCheetah-v3\" for Sparse HalfCheetah experiments, and all the environment creation code accepts an environment ID that can be set to \"HalfCheetah-v3\".",

This is typically accomplished by wrapping the environment with a normalization wrapper (for example, using VecNormalize from Stable Baselines3 or a custom observation normalization layer) so that the agent\u2019s input has standardized statistics (e.g., zero mean and unit variance). In our case\u2014specifically for the Sparse HalfCheetah environment\u2014the paper indicates that \u201cthe observations are normalized\u201d during training. Therefore, I would look for code during the environment setup or training pipelines (in training scripts or in environment wrapper files) that shows either:\n\u2022 a call to a normalization routine (e.g., VecNormalize),\n\u2022 or a custom normalization (perhaps a neural network layer or function) that is applied to the raw observations before the agent processes them.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submitted code, there is a class called RNDObservationNormalizer defined in the file \u201csrc/rnd.py\u201d. This class indeed implements a normalization routine for observations; however, its use is tied to the RND (Random Network Distillation) module. In \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d, we find that an RNDObservationNormalizer is instantiated and later used inside the RNDRewardWrapper to normalize observations before computing the intrinsic reward. Importantly, this normalization is applied solely to facilitate the computation of the intrinsic reward \u2013 the RNDRewardWrapper calls the normalizer on the observations and then returns the original (un-normalized) observations to the agent.\nFurthermore, in files such as \u201csrc/baselines.py\u201d and \u201cscripts/train_pretrained.py\u201d, the environment is created with a simple make_vec_env call without any normalization wrapper. There is a comment (\"TODO: Handle VecNormalize loading if necessary\") but no actual implementation of observation normalization is present.\nThus, while the code does include observation normalization for the RND component, it does not modify the observations that are used by the DRL agent for training in the Sparse HalfCheetah environment. There is no evidence in the submission that the observations are being normalized for the agent\u2019s input during its actual learning process in that environment.\n\n# Score\n0\n\nThe submission does not meet the criterion because it fails to show an implementation where the observations being used to train the DRL agent (specifically in the Sparse HalfCheetah environment) are normalized.

While the internal architecture specifics (a 4\u2010layer MLP with hidden sizes 128 each) are important and noted elsewhere in the paper, for this criterion the primary requirement is simply that there is code properly setting up and executing pretraining for a policy agent in the selfish mining environment. Thus, I will look for a script or module (typically in the \"scripts\" folder) that creates an environment (using a vectorized environment utility, for example) and initializes a PPO (or SAC) agent\u2014ideally using a policy network\u2014and then trains it while saving the resulting model.

Furthermore, other files (for example, in scripts/run_fidelity.py and scripts/run_refinement.py) have default hyperparameter settings that mention \"SelfishMining\" (such as in DEFAULT_D_MAX and DEFAULT_RICE_PARAMS), indicating that the framework is intended to support the selfish mining environment. There is no separate custom policy network explicitly set up for selfish mining, and the submission uses the default \"MlpPolicy\".

While there is no script titled specifically for \u201cnetwork defence\u201d, the provided pretraining script (\"train_pretrained.py\") is generic and can be directed to any gym-compatible environment by setting the appropriate env id.

According to the paper and clarifications, the autonomous driving environment should be supported by a policy network agent that is compatible with PPO. The code should instantiate an agent using a standard, generic architecture (e.g., Stable Baselines3\u2019s \u201cMlpPolicy\u201d or the VAC network from DI-engine, though the latter is not required in the reproduction) when the environment ID for autonomous driving is provided (such as \"AutoDriving\"). In other words, when a user supplies the autonomous driving environment as input, the code should create a vectorized environment for that task and initialize a PPO agent (or similar) to act within it. I will look for:\n- References to the autonomous driving environment in configuration dictionaries.\n- Code (in training/pretraining or refinement scripts) that instantiates a policy network via PPO using the environment ID that corresponds to autonomous driving.\n- Any specific default settings or parameters for the autonomous driving environment (e.g. in \u201cDEFAULT_RICE_PARAMS\u201d, \u201cDEFAULT_D_MAX\u201d, etc.) indicating support for it.\nSince the reproduction focus is on the overall pipeline rather than specific custom architectures, it is acceptable to use the default SB3 policy as long as the autonomous driving task is supported.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, the implementation is fully generic. Several files (such as \"train_pretrained.py\", \"baselines.py\", \"run_hyperparams.py\", \"run_fidelity.py\", and \"run_refinement.py\") instantiate PPO agents using SB3\u2019s default methods. For example:\n- In \"train_pretrained.py\", the code calls make_vec_env with `env_id` (which is provided as an argument) and then creates a PPO agent with policy \"MlpPolicy\". Although the default provided in the script is \"Hopper-v3\", the design is generic so that if one runs the script with an autonomous driving environment (for instance by specifying \"--env AutoDriving\"), the agent would be created for that environment.\n- In \"run_hyperparams.py\" and \"run_fidelity.py\", the DEFAULT_D_MAX dictionary includes an entry for \"AutoDriving\" (with a value of 20.0). Similarly, \"run_refinement.py\" has a DEFAULT_RICE_PARAMS dictionary that contains a key \"AutoDriving\" (with parameters {\"p_critical\": 0.25, \"lambda_intrinsic\": 0.01}). These entries show explicit support for the autonomous driving environment.\n- The code throughout is designed to take an environment ID as an argument, and since the reproduction instructions state that a generic RL agent will suffice, it is acceptable that the policy network for autonomous driving is implemented using the default policy architecture from Stable Baselines3.\nThus, while there is no separate or custom autonomous driving policy network distinct from the generic PPO agent, the submission does provide code that\u2014when configured with the appropriate environment ID (\u201cAutoDriving\u201d)\u2014will implement and use an RL policy network agent for that environment.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1. The submission meets the criterion because it contains a correct, generic implementation for setting up an RL policy network agent (compatible with PPO) for any environment\u2014including the autonomous driving environment\u2014by leveraging standard components from Stable Baselines3 and by including specific configuration entries (e.g., in DEFAULT_D_MAX and DEFAULT_RICE_PARAMS) for \"AutoDriving.\" There is no need for a custom architecture beyond the generic SB3 policy, per the addendum.",

In practice, that means the code should use a reinforcement learning algorithm (in this case, PPO) to optimize the modified reward that implicitly represents \u03b7(\ud835\udf0b\u0304) (i.e. the expected return when the mask network is used). In addition, there should be a bonus or adjustment in the reward (for example, a reward bonus for taking the \u201cblinding\u201d action) that encourages the mask network to explore nontrivial masking. I will specifically look in the files (especially state_mask.py) for:\n\u2013 Evidence that the reward returned by the environment is modified (for example by adding an extra bonus term weighted by a parameter, such as \u201calpha\u201d).\n\u2013 That the mask network is trained using PPO with this modified reward, so that the training objective becomes equivalent to J(\u03b8)=max \u03b7(\ud835\udf0b\u0304).\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, the file \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d defines the MaskNetworkPolicy class and, more importantly, a wrapper class called MaskEnvWrapper. In the MaskEnvWrapper\u2019s step_wait method, the rewards are modified by adding a bonus term:\n\u2003\u2003modified_rewards = rewards + self.alpha * self._current_mask_actions\nHere, self._current_mask_actions come from the mask network\u2019s output (which is a discrete action: 0 or 1). This bonus reward is used to incentivize the network\u2019s \u201cblinding\u201d action and is exactly in line with the transformation in the paper that turns the objective into maximizing \u03b7(\ud835\udf0b\u0304).\nMoreover, the function train_mask_network in the same file creates a PPO model using MaskNetworkPolicy on the wrapped environment. Since PPO inherently maximizes the expected return, by setting up the environment to provide \u201cmodified rewards,\u201d this training setup implicitly optimizes J(\u03b8)=max\u03b7(\ud835\udf0b\u0304) for the mask network.\nThus, although the code does not explicitly write \u201cJ(\u03b8)=max \u03b7(\ud835\udf0b\u0304)\u201d in its source, it does implement the transformation by (1) modifying the reward in MaskEnvWrapper (which is applied in MuJoCo environments like Hopper-v3) and (2) training with PPO.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1\nThe submission meets the criterion.

In a correct implementation, there will be a dedicated mask network class (here, MaskNetworkPolicy) that is used to compute step\u2010level importance scores during retraining. This class should provide a function (e.g., predict_mask_prob) that returns the probability associated with the \u201cblinding\u201d action so that its complement serves as the importance score. Additionally, the retraining routines (for example, in the RICE training code) should load this improved mask network via a mechanism (such as passing custom_objects to the load_policy function) and use it in callbacks (like RICECallback) to select critical states. My review will look for:\n\u2013 A specific implementation of MaskNetworkPolicy that implements the necessary functions.\n\u2013 Code paths in retraining (e.g., in train_rice or related callbacks) that load and use this mask network to compute importance scores.\n\u2013 The ability to choose between using the mask network (\u201cOurs\u201d method) and a random baseline (by checking if an explanation policy is provided).\n\n# Reality\nThe submission contains several files that relate to this requirement:\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d the class MaskNetworkPolicy is defined. It extends ActorCriticPolicy and implements a predict_mask_prob method that returns, after processing the observations, the probability (from the mask network\u2019s distribution) corresponding to the \u201cblind\u201d action. This method is essential for obtaining importance scores (by taking 1 minus the returned probability).\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/fidelity.py\u201d, the function get_importance_scores calls policy.predict_mask_prob to obtain step\u2010level importance scores. This shows that the improved explanation method (MaskNetworkPolicy) is used when available.\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d, the train_rice routine loads a mask network using PPO.load with a custom_objects argument specifying MaskNetworkPolicy. Later in RICECallback (also in \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d) the mask_policy\u2019s predict_mask_prob is used to determine importance scores and update critical states.\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/baselines.py\u201d, there is a separate training function for \u201cStateMask-R\u201d which is clearly distinct from the improved \u201cOurs\u201d version, indicating that the submission differentiates between the two.\nOverall, I see a clear mechanism by which a user can select the improved (\"Ours\") StateMask explanation method for retraining via providing a trained mask network file (via mask_network_path) and having that loaded using the MaskNetworkPolicy. The presence of custom_objects={ 'policy_class': MaskNetworkPolicy } when calling load_policy in multiple places confirms that the system is set up to use the improved method.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe code clearly provides a correct implementation of the improved (\u201cOurs\u201d) StateMask explanation method that can be selected during retraining of the MuJoCo environments.

In this design, the network should output a binary decision per step: a value of \u201c0\u201d should indicate that the step is deemed critical (i.e. the target agent\u2019s normal behavior is preserved), while \u201c1\u201d should indicate a non\u2010critical step (leading to the agent being \u201cblinded\u201d or randomized). In concrete terms, I would look for a class (for example, a MaskNetworkPolicy) that forces the action space to Discrete(2) and, when used to compute importance scores (for instance via a function that returns \u201c1 \u2013 probability of action 1\u201d), it implies that a low probability of selecting \u201c1\u201d means a high probability of \u201c0\u201d which marks the step as critical.\n\n# Reality  \nIn the submitted code, the file \"src/state_mask.py\" defines a class called MaskNetworkPolicy that inherits from ActorCriticPolicy. In its constructor, the code forces the mask agent\u2019s action space to be gym.spaces.Discrete(2) and includes the comment \"0: keep, 1: blind\", which exactly corresponds to the idea that a \u201c0\u201d output signals a critical (kept) step and a \u201c1\u201d signals a non\u2010critical (blinded) step.  \nAdditionally, in the method predict_mask_prob, the network computes and returns the probability for taking action 1 (i.e. \u201cblinding\u201d). Meanwhile, in \"src/fidelity.py\", the function get_importance_scores uses this output, computing the importance as 1.0 minus the probability of action 1. Hence, if the network outputs 0 for a step (implying a high importance score), that step is treated as critical. Although the implementation is generic (and used across environments) rather than being exclusive to the selfish mining environment, it is clear from the documentation and the code comments that the intended behavior is to produce a \u201c0\u201d for critical steps and \u201c1\u201d otherwise.

(2023) \u2013 during the retraining process. A correct resolution would include:\n\u2022 A concrete implementation of the original StateMask explanation method. Typically, this would be embodied in a dedicated class (for example, \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d) that outputs binary mask actions (with \u201c0\u201d corresponding to a critical step and \u201c1\u201d to non\u2010critical steps) and implements the training objective as described in the paper (i.e. roughly minimizing |\u03b7(\u03c0) \u2013 \u03b7(\u03c0\u0304)|).\n\u2022 In the retraining code (such as in baseline retraining functions for the selfish mining environment) the code should offer an option\u2014likely via selecting a custom policy class or a command-line flag\u2014to choose this original StateMask explanation method.\n\u2022 Specifically, I will look for code segments using \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d (or an equivalent identifier) in files that set up retraining (e.g., in baselines.py and state_mask.py) and evidence that it can be loaded/selected via the \u201cload_policy\u201d function in fidelity.py or similar routines.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission contains a file named \u201cstate_mask.py\u201d in which a class called \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d is defined. This class is a subclass of the standard ActorCriticPolicy and is designed to work with a Discrete(2) action space \u2013 exactly the expected behavior for the original StateMask method (with the convention that it outputs \u201c0\u201d for critical steps and \u201c1\u201d for non\u2010critical ones). The implementation includes a method called \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d that returns probabilities for the mask action and other auxiliary methods.\nAdditionally, in \u201cbaselines.py\u201d there is a function called \u201ctrain_statemask_r\u201d which calls \u201cload_policy\u201d with a parameter \u201ccustom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy\u201d. This clearly indicates that during retraining the original StateMask method can be selected by loading the mask network using \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d. In \u201cfidelity.py\u201d there is also logic that refers to \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d when loading the explanation policy. Although the code is not explicitly segregated by environment (for instance, there is no \u201cif environment==SelfishMining\u201d check), the hyperparameter dictionaries (e.g., in \u201crun_hyperparams.py\u201d and \u201crun_refinement.py\u201d) include keys for \u201cSelfishMining\u201d. This means that for the selfish mining environment the same option (using MaskNetworkPolicy) would be available. Overall, the submission provides the actual code (not just instructions) for the original StateMask Explanation method and integrates it such that during retraining (e.g. in the \u201ctrain_statemask_r\u201d function) one can select and use it.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submission meets the criterion because it includes a proper implementation of the original StateMask Explanation method via the \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d class in \u201cstate_mask.py\u201d and provides functions (e.g., \u201ctrain_statemask_r\u201d in \u201cbaselines.py\u201d and proper use in \u201cfidelity.py\u201d) that allow the method to be selected during retraining, which is applicable to the selfish mining environment.",

Because PPO is inherently a return\u2010maximization algorithm, by training the mask network via mask_model.learn() under this reward modification the code is effectively optimizing the mask network with the objective J(\u03b8)= max\u2009\u03b7(\ud835\udec3\u03c0).

In the context of the selfish mining environment (or, as implemented generically for all environments) the reward function should add an extra reward when the mask network outputs \"1\" and that extra reward should be the product of this hyperparameter and an indicator (or the mask action value).

This integration in a retraining pipeline is exactly what is expected.\n\u2022 The default parameters for methods in \"scripts/run_refinement.py\" include entries for the SelfishMining environment (e.g., DEFAULT_RICE_PARAMS has a key \"SelfishMining\"), which further confirms that the pipeline has been set up to handle the selfish mining environment.\nOverall, the submission contains actual code in state_mask.py and rice.py that implements the ability to use the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method (the optimized StateMask) during retraining.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1\n\nThe provided code implements MaskNetworkPolicy in state_mask.py and integrates its loading and use via custom_objects in the train_rice function of rice.py.

In practice this means that:\n\u2022\u2003There is an implementation of a MaskNetworkPolicy (or similar) that, when loaded, has a method (such as \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d) which will generate step\u2010level importance scores without being in a training phase.\n\u2022\u2003There is a mechanism (for example in a rollout or evaluation function) that accepts an \u201cexplanation policy\u201d and uses its inference function to obtain importance scores and select \u201ccritical segments\u201d \u2013 this code path should work regardless of whether the mask network was trained beforehand.\n\u2022\u2003We also expect supporting code (such as load_policy functions and evaluation functions in fidelity.py) that show the explanation method can be chosen (via, e.g., passing the mask policy as the \u201cexplanation_policy\u201d) when running rollouts. Although the submission does not need a special branch solely for selfish mining, there should be configuration or default keys (e.g., dictionary entries keyed \u201cSelfishMining\u201d) so that when the selfish mining environment is selected, the same \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method is used for generating rollouts (again, using inference only).\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, several files provide the necessary components:\n\u2022\u2003In \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d the class MaskNetworkPolicy is defined. This class inherits from ActorCriticPolicy and implements a method called \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d that takes an observation (or batch of observations) and returns the probability for mask action 1 (i.e. blinding) \u2013 with the \u201cimportance score\u201d computed as 1 minus that probability. This is precisely the functionality expected for the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.\n\u2022\u2003In \u201csrc/fidelity.py\u201d, the function get_importance_scores uses the provided policy\u2019s \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d (after ensuring the network is set to inference mode) to compute importance scores. This function is then used in calculate_fidelity_score to generate rollouts where a \u201ccritical segment\u201d is selected based on these scores. The code here supports the inference-only mode (it does not initiate any training).\n\u2022\u2003Additionally, in \u201cscripts/run_fidelity.py\u201d, keys in the default D_MAX dictionary include \u201cSelfishMining\u201d, and in \u201cscripts/run_refinement.py\u201d, the DEFAULT_RICE_PARAMS dictionary has a key for \u201cSelfishMining\u201d. These indicate that the codebase is aware of the selfish mining environment and has environment\u2010specific defaults. Thus, if one were to run the evaluation or refinement experiments in the selfish mining environment (by specifying \u201cSelfishMining\u201d as the environment ID), the code would use the mask network (i.e. the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method) for generating rollouts.\n\u2022\u2003Furthermore, the load_policy function in \u201cfidelity.py\u201d and also in \u201cbaselines.py\u201d is designed to load a policy file and correctly use the MaskNetworkPolicy if the custom object is specified. This means the user can choose the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method by loading a model with this policy type.\nOverall, while the code is written in a generic manner (supporting multiple environments) rather than having an isolated code branch just for selfish mining, the provided files contain all the necessary components to select and use the StateMask (\"Ours\") Explanation method in rollout generation (in inference mode, without additional training).\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1. The submission provides a correct implementation: the MaskNetworkPolicy (in \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d) includes the \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d method, and functions in \u201csrc/fidelity.py\u201d correctly use this to generate explanation rollouts. The default dictionaries in the scripts include entries for \u201cSelfishMining,\u201d which indicates that when the selfish mining environment is used, the optimized explanation method (\u201cOurs\u201d) can be selected for generating rollouts without training.",

In other words, instead of using a mask network or any other deterministic/explanation mechanism, the implementation should, for each trajectory, generate a random set of importance values (or choose an index randomly) that is then used to identify a \u201ccritical\u201d segment of states. Typically, one would expect a function that either plucks a random state index or, equivalently, returns random numbers for each step (thus making the later choice of the \u201ccritical\u201d step effectively random). Specifically, in the context of the submission, I would look for a function (or branch) that bypasses the normal computation of importance scores (via the mask network) and instead computes the scores randomly. This should be integrated into the fidelity evaluation or explanation selection process for the selfish mining experiments.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission includes the file \"src/fidelity.py,\" where I found the following function:\n\n\u2003\u2003def get_random_importance_scores(trajectory_length: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003# Returns random importance scores.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003return np.random.rand(trajectory_length)\n\nThis function clearly generates an array of random importance scores of the given trajectory length. In the \"calculate_fidelity_score\" function (also in \"src/fidelity.py\"), there is a conditional branch that checks if an explanation policy is provided; if it is not, then it calls get_random_importance_scores to get random importance scores. This matches the idea of the \u201cRandom\u201d Explanation method as outlined in the paper section 4.1, where critical steps for explaining the agent\u2019s behavior are chosen by randomly picking from the visited states.\n\nAlthough the code is written in a general setting (i.e., it applies to any environment), it will serve for the selfish mining environment as well. There is no code specific only to selfish mining; however, that is acceptable because the same random explanation methodology is expected to be used across environments, including selfish mining. The implementation thus meets the requirement that, when the random baseline is desired (i.e., no explanation policy is provided), critical steps are identified based solely on random values.\n\n# Score\nI assign a score of 1 because the submission includes a function that implements the \"Random\" Explanation method as expected.

In the paper the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method is defined as one that selects critical steps by randomly choosing among the visited states rather than using the mask network prediction. In a correct implementation I would expect to see:\n\u2013 A function that, when the random method is chosen (typically indicated by not providing an explanation policy), returns random importance scores for each time step in a trajectory (e.g. via np.random.rand).\n\u2013 That this \u201crandom explanation\u201d path is selectable in the overall evaluation/retraining code (for instance, by passing a None value for the explanation_policy argument in functions such as calculate_fidelity_score or by a flag in the retraining scripts).\n\u2013 In the context of the selfish mining environment (which is one of the experimental settings), the default configuration (often in a dictionary or similar) should include parameters for \u201cSelfishMining\u201d, ensuring that if the environment \u201cSelfishMining\u201d is used, then the random explanation can be selected.\n\nI would look in the submission for a function named something like \u201cget_random_importance_scores\u201d and checks (if explanation_policy is None) that then random scores are used. I would also expect that the scripts or evaluation code (especially those meant for the selfish mining environment) allow one to select random explanation versus a mask network explanation.\n\n# Reality\n\nIn the submission I found that in the file \u201csrc/fidelity.py\u201d there is a function defined as follows:\n\u2003\u2003def get_random_importance_scores(trajectory_length: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003return np.random.rand(trajectory_length)\n\nThis function returns random importance scores for each step in the trajectory.

In this script, if the mask network policy fails to load or if one purposely does not provide it, the random baseline is used (by passing explanation_policy as None). Although the retraining pipelines in \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d and \u201csrc/baselines.py\u201d do not show any explicit branch labeled for the \u201cRandom\u201d Explanation method, the fidelity evaluation and the testing utilities clearly allow for the random explanation baseline to be selected via the mechanism described above.\n\nThis aligns with the paper\u2019s description whereby the \u201cRandom\u201d Explanation method is implemented by randomly selecting previously visited states (as simulated by get_random_importance_scores) and is available as an alternative explanation method during retraining/evaluation.\n\n# Score\n\nI give a score of 1. The submission contains a clear implementation of the random explanation method (via the get_random_importance_scores function and its use in calculate_fidelity_score when explanation_policy is None), and the configuration in the scripts (including an entry for \u201cSelfishMining\u201d in the default D_MAX dictionary) shows that one can select this random baseline for the selfish mining environment.

There is no code that computes or minimizes the specific absolute difference between the expected returns (i.e. there is no piece of code that computes something like \u201closs = abs(eta(pi) - eta(masked_pi))\u201d and backpropagates on that).

In practice, this means there should be a dedicated module (or class) \u2013 typically something like a \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d \u2013 that implements the mask network which outputs a binary decision (with \u201c0\u201d indicating that the target agent\u2019s action is kept and \u201c1\u201d that it should be replaced by a random action). In addition, the retraining code should allow the user to select this explanation method (for example, by specifying the mask network class when loading the explanation method or by passing an appropriate parameter) so that, during retraining, the original StateMask method is used instead of, say, a random explanation. I will look for such an implementation (ideally in a file like \u201cstate_mask.py\u201d) and verify that subsequent modules (e.g., those handling fidelity scoring or retraining such as in \u201crice.py\u201d or \u201cbaselines.py\u201d) import and utilize this implementation.\n\n# Reality\nIn the provided submission, the file \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d defines a class called \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d that extends an actor\u2013critic policy (ActorCriticPolicy) from Stable Baselines3. The code forces the mask network\u2019s action space to be a discrete space with two values (using gym.spaces.Discrete(2)), which corresponds to the two possible outputs (\u201c0\u201d for keeping the target action \u2013 meaning the step is critical \u2013 and \u201c1\u201d for blinding the agent by replacing the target action with a random action). In particular, the method \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d computes and returns the probability of taking action 1 (blinding), and the fidelity head in \u201csrc/fidelity.py\u201d computes the importance score as 1 minus that probability. This design matches the description in the paper and exactly what is required for the original StateMask explanation method. \n\nMoreover, in several other files (e.g., \u201csrc/fidelity.py\u201d, \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d, and \u201csrc/baselines.py\u201d), the submission imports and uses \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d from \u201cstate_mask.py\u201d. This indicates that the code is designed to allow a user to select the original StateMask explanation method as the explanation component during retraining (for instance, by loading a model with \u201ccustom_objects={'policy_class': MaskNetworkPolicy}\u201d). Although the submission does not contain environment\u2010specific naming for the network defence setting, the modularity of the implementation implies that any environment \u2013 including the network defence one \u2013 can select the original StateMask method via the provided \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d.\n\n# Score\nI assign a score of 1.

In our specific network defence environment setting, a user should be able to load a pretrained mask network (using something like the load_policy function in fidelity.py) and then run rollouts where the importance scores are computed from the pretrained MaskNetworkPolicy by calling its predict_mask_prob method. I will look for code where (1) the original mask network, as defined in state_mask.py, is implemented, (2) it is usable without additional training (i.e. there is code that simply loads and uses the network), and (3) it is used to generate rollouts (for example, within the fidelity score computations or rollout functions) with no training step.\n  \n# Reality\nIn the submission the file \"src/state_mask.py\" clearly implements the MaskNetworkPolicy class.

Then, the calculated importance scores (1.0 minus the mask-probability) are used in the logic for selecting a critical segment and running a \"perturbed\" rollout. Notice that there is no training of the mask network within this function; it simply uses the provided network. The load_policy function in fidelity.py is designed to load a model that uses a MaskNetworkPolicy, which confirms that one can select the original StateMask method for generating rollouts without further training. \n\nAlthough there is no file explicitly dedicated solely to the \"network defence environment,\" the code is generic enough to be applied to it (e.g. in a Cage Challenge environment) and the same mechanism for selecting the original explanation method (via MaskNetworkPolicy) is available.

Importantly, this bonus must be scaled by a hyperparameter (\u03b1) whose value can be controlled externally (for example, via a command-line argument or configuration file) without needing to manually edit the source code. In the paper this hyperparameter \u03b1 governs the weight given to the bonus reward, and alternative names are allowed as long as the functionality is the same. Thus, I will look for code where, in the computation of rewards in the environment wrapper that uses the mask network, the reward is modified by adding something like \u201c\u03b1 * [indicator of mask = 1]\u201d.

In the \"step_wait\" method of \"MaskEnvWrapper\", the original reward is modified by adding the term \"self.alpha * self._current_mask_actions\". This clearly implements the additional reward bonus when the mask network outputs \"1\" (since _current_mask_actions would indicate the mask outputs). Additionally, looking in \"scripts/train_mask.py\", I see that the command-line parser defines an argument \"--alpha\", which, if provided, sets the alpha hyperparameter; if not provided, a default is selected from a dictionary (DEFAULT_ALPHAS). This confirms that the hyperparameter is intended to be mutable without editing the code directly. The design meets the requirement by exposing \u201calpha\u201d as an external parameter both in the MaskEnvWrapper and in the training script setup.\n\n# Score\nI award a score of 1.

In practice, this should be implemented by (a) providing a dedicated policy class\u2014for example, a \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d\u2014that embodies the \u201cOurs\u201d method, and (b) by making sure that when running the retraining procedure (for example via the RICE or mask network training routines), one can select this optimized explanation method via configuration or by passing a custom policy class (typically via a parameter such as custom_policy_class). In particular, for the network defense environment (which might be identified by names like \u201cCageChallenge2\u201d or similar), the system should load the corresponding mask model using this \u201cOurs\u201d implementation so that users can properly select it for retraining.\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the provided submission, I locate the relevant code in the following files:\n- In **src/state_mask.py**, there is a definition of \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d that inherits from ActorCriticPolicy. This class forces a discrete action space (representing the binary masking decision) and defines methods such as `predict_mask_prob` (which returns the probability of taking the \u201cblind\u201d action). This implementation represents the \u201cOurs\u201d optimized explanation method.\n- In **src/fidelity.py**, the function `load_policy` is defined. When a custom policy class is provided\u2014specifically via the argument custom_policy_class\u2014it uses that class to instantiate and load the mask model. In several calls (and in the example at the end of the file), MaskNetworkPolicy is passed as the custom_policy_class. This is the mechanism for selecting the optimized (\u201cOurs\u201d) explanation method.\n- In **scripts/run_fidelity.py** and **scripts/train_mask.py**, the code uses `load_policy` with `custom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy` and calls the `train_mask_network` function from state_mask. While these scripts are written in a generic way (applicable to any environment), in the default configuration (and for environments such as \u201cCageChallenge2\u201d which appears in the D_MAX dictionary inside run_fidelity.py), the user could specify the network defense environment and thereby have the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method selected.\n\nEven though the submission does not include an environment-specific branch exclusively for network defense, it clearly supports retraining with the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method through the custom loading of MaskNetworkPolicy. This fits our expectations because the code offers a means to select the optimized StateMask method during retraining in any environment\u2014network defense included\u2014by passing the correct parameters and file names.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submission provides a correct implementation of the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method via the MaskNetworkPolicy (in src/state_mask.py) and shows its integration in the retraining routines (e.g., via load_policy in src/fidelity.py and its use in training and refinement scripts). This meets the criterion that for the network defense environment the optimized StateMask explanation method can be selected during retraining.",

It extends ActorCriticPolicy and defines the method predict_mask_prob, which computes the probability of taking the \u201cblind\u201d action. This method is intended to be used during inference. There is no training logic in predict_mask_prob\u2014it sets the network to evaluation mode and only performs a forward pass.\n\u2022 In src/fidelity.py, the helper function get_importance_scores calls policy.predict_mask_prob on input states, then computes importance scores (1 \u2013 probability). This function is used to generate an explanation from a (pre\u2010trained) mask network without any training occurring during rollout generation.\n\u2022 In several script files (e.g. scripts/run_fidelity.py and scripts/run_refinement.py), the load_policy helper function is used with a custom_policy_class argument to load MaskNetworkPolicy. For example, when loading the mask network the call is made as:\n\u2003\u2003mask_policy = load_policy(DUMMY_MASK_PATH, 'PPO', custom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy)\nThis indicates that the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method can be selected for generating rollouts.\n\u2022 Although the files are generic (i.e. they handle several environments), there are default parameter dictionaries (for instance, in run_fidelity.py and run_refinement.py) that include entries for \u201cCageChallenge2\u201d, which is the network defense environment. This shows that the code supports network defense alongside other environments.\nOverall, the code clearly provides a mechanism to load and run the optimized StateMask (\u201cOurs\u201d) explanation method in inference mode for generating rollouts. No training routines are invoked for generating explanations in this context.\n\n# Score\n1 \u2013 The submission meets the criterion. The code contains a correct implementation (notably in src/state_mask.py and its usage in src/fidelity.py) that allows the selection of the \"Ours\" explanation method (via MaskNetworkPolicy and predict_mask_prob) for generating rollouts without training, and it supports the network defense environment as evidenced by default parameters and naming conventions.",

Moreover, within \u201ccalculate_fidelity_score\u201d in the same file, there is a clear conditional: if an \u201cexplanation_policy\u201d is provided it uses that policy\u2019s \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d method; otherwise (i.e. when \u201cexplanation_policy\u201d is None) it calls \u201cget_random_importance_scores\u201d to generate random scores. In \u201cscripts/run_fidelity.py\u201d, the code explicitly adds a \u201cRandom\u201d method option by appending (\u201cRandom\u201d, None) to the list of methods to run. This demonstrates that the random explanation option can be selected. Although the code does not exclusively mention the \u201cnetwork defence environment\u201d by name, the implementation is generic and applies to any environment (including network defence) provided the proper environment ID is used. The provided implementation meets the requirement: when retraining (or evaluating fidelity), one can select \u201cRandom\u201d as the explanation method simply by passing no explanation policy (i.e. None) so that the code uses random importance scores.\n\n# Score  \n1 \u2013 The submission includes a correct and selectable implementation of the \u201cRandom\u201d Explanation method (via the conditional branch in \u201ccalculate_fidelity_score\u201d and the helper function \u201cget_random_importance_scores\u201d), which satisfies the criterion.",

I would look for a dedicated implementation or fallback branch that, when selected, uses a random function (for example, generating random scores) to mark importance. Specifically, I expect to see a function (or branch in a function) that, instead of using a trained mask network, simply returns random importance scores (e.g. using np.random.rand) and that this random explanation option is selectable (for example, by providing a None value for an explanation policy).

This again shows that the random explanation is selectable.\n- Although the submission does not have environment-specific code for network defence, the implementation is generic enough that for any chosen environment (including network defence), one can select the random explanation method simply by not providing an explanation policy.\n\nThus, the code provides a correct implementation of the \u201cRandom\u201d Explanation method option.

I will look for this logic in the code \u2013 for example, in the definition of the mask network (likely in state_mask.py) and in its use inside an environment wrapper where the mask action is checked (typically via a condition such as \u201cif mask == 1 then take a random action, else use target policy action\u201d).

This logic implies that when the mask network outputs 0, the target_policy\u2019s action is used (and the step is thus considered \u201ccritical\u201d). This exactly meets the expectation that the mask network should output \u201c0\u201d for critical steps and \u201c1\u201d for non-critical ones.

Although there isn\u2019t an environment-specific branch for autonomous driving, the implementation is generic and, by design, can be applied in any environment \u2013 including autonomous driving. Furthermore, in \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d and \u201csrc/baselines.py\u201d the code imports MaskNetworkPolicy from \u201cstate_mask.py\u201d, and the refinement routines (as seen in \u201cscripts/run_refinement.py\u201d) permit the selection of a mask network file (via the parameter \u201cmask_network_path\u201d).

It is implemented for a discrete action space (with two outputs) and provides the method \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d to return the probability for one of the binary outcomes (with 1\u2009\u2013\u2009probability used as an importance score). This implementation aligns with the original StateMask method as described.\n\u2022 The \u201cfidelity.py\u201d file imports MaskNetworkPolicy from state_mask.py and uses a helper function \u201cget_importance_scores\u201d that calls \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d on the passed policy. This indicates that the rollout generation process can directly use a loaded mask network without extra training.\n\u2022 The load_policy functions in both \u201cfidelity.py\u201d and \u201cbaselines.py\u201d allow for a \u201ccustom_policy_class\u201d parameter which can be set to MaskNetworkPolicy. This enables the system to load a pre-trained (or dummy) mask network, meaning that users can choose the original StateMask method for generating rollouts.\n\u2022 Although the code is written generically (with no explicit hardcoded branch for the autonomous driving environment), it is expected that the replication is designed to be generic and applicable to any environment (including autonomous driving). By supplying an autonomous driving environment ID, the user would have the option to load MaskNetworkPolicy as the explanation method.\n\nOverall, the submission includes a correct implementation of the original StateMask Explanation method and provides mechanisms (via load_policy and get_importance_scores) to use it for generating rollouts without training.\n\n# Score\nI assign a score of 1.

In other words, instead of a loss function that might for example minimize a difference or error, the optimization is recast as  \n\u2003\u2003J(\u03b8) = max\u202f\u03b7(\u03c0\u0304)  \nIn the code this should appear as a transformation of the reward function or environment wrapper such that when the mask network is trained (e.g. via PPO), it receives modified rewards that include an incentive term (a bonus) corresponding to taking the \u201cblinding\u201d action. Thus, I expect to see:  \n- An environment wrapper (or similar mechanism) that modifies rewards (by adding a bonus when mask action = 1) so that the effective reward used in training becomes the sum of the base reward and the bonus.  \n- A training function for the mask network (using PPO) that uses these modified rewards to drive learning.  \n- While the code need not mention \u201cJ(\u03b8) = max \u03b7(\u03c0\u0304)\u201d explicitly, the construction should clearly result in a maximization objective for the perturbed policy.  \n\n# Reality  \nThe submission provides the file \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d which implements the mask network and its training routine. In particular:  \n- The class MaskNetworkPolicy is defined and inherits from ActorCriticPolicy. It provides a method `predict_mask_prob` which returns the probability of the mask taking the blind action.  \n- The file implements a wrapper class named MaskEnvWrapper. In its `step_wait` method it calculates modified rewards as:  \n\u2003\u2003modified_rewards = rewards + self.alpha * self._current_mask_actions  \nThis means whenever the mask network decides to take the \u201cblind\u201d action (action 1), a bonus proportional to \u03b1 is added to the reward.  \n- The function `train_mask_network` in the same file creates a PPO model with MaskNetworkPolicy on a wrapped environment. PPO, being a maximization algorithm, will update the mask network parameters to maximize the accumulated (discounted) modified rewards.  \n  \nEven though the code does not include any autonomous driving\u2013specific branches, it is written in a generic fashion so that it will be used with any compatible environment (including an autonomous driving one). The key point is that the mechanism for optimizing the mask network is to maximize the return received from the environment augmented with the bonus. That is exactly equivalent to optimizing J(\u03b8)=max\u202f\u03b7(\u03c0\u0304), as specified in the criterion.  \n\n# Score  \nI award a score of 1. The submission does implement a training setup for the mask network in \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d that uses a modified reward (by adding an alpha bonus when a mask action is taken) and trains via PPO to maximize the cumulative reward, which is equivalent to maximizing \u03b7(\u03c0\u0304). This meets the criterion that for the autonomous driving environment the objective being optimized is J(\u03b8)=max\u202f\u03b7(\u03c0\u0304).",

It implements the predict_mask_prob method (which returns the probability for the \u201cblind\u201d action) and a predict_mask_action method. This class is used to represent the optimized \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.\n\u2022 In \"src/rice.py\", within the train_rice function, the code loads the mask network by calling PPO.load with a custom_objects parameter that specifies {'policy_class': MaskNetworkPolicy}. This indicates that when a mask network file is provided, the retraining process will use the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.\n\u2022 The script \"src/fidelity.py\" includes a function get_importance_scores that calls the mask network method predict_mask_prob on a given trajectory, meaning the explanation method is explicitly used to compute step-level importance.\n\u2022 Additionally, the scripts in the \"scripts\" folder (such as run_refinement.py and run_fidelity.py) include logic for selecting between methods (e.g., \u201crice\u201d vs. a random baseline) and mention the mask network via its file path.\nAlthough no section is exclusively labeled as \u201cautonomous driving,\u201d the code is designed to be generic and accepts environment IDs (e.g., \u201cAutoDriving\u201d could be one) and uses environment-specific parameters set in dictionaries (for instance in DEFAULT_RICE_PARAMS). The submission\u2019s generic design confirms it can be used for autonomous driving as required.\nOverall, the submission provides the necessary code to load, train, and select the optimized \u201cOurs\u201d state mask (StateMask) explanation method during retraining.\n\n# Score\n1\n\nThe submission meets the criterion because it contains a complete implementation of the optimized \u201cOurs\u201d StateMask explanation method (via MaskNetworkPolicy in src/state_mask.py), and it is integrated into the retraining pipeline (in train_rice in src/rice.py and in fidelity calculations) so that it can be selected for use in environments such as autonomous driving.",

In code terms, I would expect to see the following:\n\u2022 A clear implementation of the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method in a dedicated class (typically a subclass of the base policy) that provides a method (e.g., predict_mask_prob) which returns the step\u2010level importance scores for a trajectory.\n\u2022 The ability to \"select\" this explanation method during rollout generation \u2013 for instance by loading a pre\u2010trained mask network via a function like load_policy (passing custom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy) and then using it in rollout\u2010generation functions (such as in calculate_fidelity_score).\n\u2022 Since the criterion specifies \u201cwithout training,\u201d I expect that the code uses this pre\u2010trained (or externally provided) \u2018Ours\u2019 explanation method purely in inference mode (i.e. calls set_training_mode(False) before predicting) and uses its output to decide which parts of the trajectory to perturb.\nEven though the autonomous driving environment is not explicitly hardcoded, the system should be generic for any gym environment including autonomous driving; so if the user sets env_id to an autonomous driving simulator, the code for generating rollouts should work with the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.\n\n# Reality\nLooking into the submission files:\n\u2022 The file src/state_mask.py defines a MaskNetworkPolicy class that inherits from ActorCriticPolicy. This class implements a method predict_mask_prob which computes the probability of choosing the \u201cblind\u201d (mask) action. This is essentially the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method implementation \u2013 the version that is optimized using PPO rather than a prime-dual method. There is no separate training logic in the rollout functions.\n\u2022 In src/fidelity.py, the function get_importance_scores calls policy.predict_mask_prob after setting training mode to False. This function is used by calculate_fidelity_score to generate importance scores from an explanation_policy. In the context of autonomous driving (or any environment), a pre\u2010trained mask network can be loaded (using load_policy with custom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy) and then used to generate rollouts with the StateMask (\"Ours\") method.\n\u2022 In addition, the file src/rice.py also loads the mask network via PPO.load with custom_objects={'policy_class': MaskNetworkPolicy}. This shows that the system allows selection of the optimized mask network during refinement.\n\u2022 The provided scripts (such as run_fidelity.py and run_refinement.py) are generic but support loading and using the mask network. They do not retrain the explanation method when generating rollouts; rather, they call set_training_mode(False) and use the predict_mask_prob function. Thus, the submission indeed gives a mechanism to select the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method for generating rollouts without training.\nWhile the code is written generically (and works for any gym environment), an autonomous driving environment would be used by setting a corresponding env_id. The submission indeed supports that by using stable-baselines3 interfaces. No explicit separate implementation for autonomous driving is provided, but that is acceptable given the black-box assumption.\nOverall, the files in state_mask.py and fidelity.py (and their integrations in rice.py and the scripts) meet the expectations for letting the user select the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method to generate rollouts without additional training.\n\n# Score\nI assign a score of 1. The submission contains a correct implementation \u2013 in particular, the MaskNetworkPolicy in state_mask.py, the get_importance_scores function in fidelity.py, and the usage via load_policy in both fidelity.py and rice.py \u2013 which together demonstrate that a pre\u2010trained \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method can be selected and used to generate rollouts (without further training) for any environment, including the autonomous driving environment.",

The paper (Section 4.1 and the addendum) describes that the Random method simply identifies critical steps by randomly selecting among previously visited states. In code, this should look like a function that takes the trajectory length (or the set of visited states) and outputs a vector of random scores (for example, using np.random.rand). This output will then be fed into the sliding-window procedure that selects the critical segment based on the average of these random scores. I will specifically look for a function (or branch) that generates random numbers as the importance scores and for its use in the fidelity score calculation when no explanation policy is provided.\n\n# Reality  \nIn the submitted code within \"src/fidelity.py\", there is a function defined as follows:  \n\u2003\u2003def get_random_importance_scores(trajectory_length: int) -> np.ndarray:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003return np.random.rand(trajectory_length)  \nThis function fulfills the expected behavior by returning a vector of random numbers of length equal to the trajectory length. In the same file, within the function calculate_fidelity_score, the code checks whether an explanation_policy is provided. If not (i.e. when using the Random Explanation baseline), it invokes get_random_importance_scores(trajectory_length). Although this function is generic (i.e. not explicitly tied to the autonomous driving environment), it serves the purpose for all environments, including autonomous driving. Therefore, when running the fidelity evaluation on the autonomous driving environment (presumably passed as the environment ID), if the user sets explanation_policy to None, then the random scores will be used to select a critical segment. This is exactly in line with the criterion as outlined in Section 4.1 of the paper, where the critical step selection for the Random explanation method is based on randomly assigning importance scores from visited states.\n\n# Score  \nI award a score of 1, because the submission includes a correct implementation of the \"Random\" Explanation method. The function get_random_importance_scores in \"src/fidelity.py\" correctly generates random importance scores, and its proper usage in calculate_fidelity_score confirms that when no explanation_policy is provided, the random baseline is used to identify critical segments.

In the paper the \u201cRandom\u201d Explanation method is defined to randomly select visited states as the critical steps. Thus, a correct implementation would provide code that, instead of using a learned or optimized explanation network (StateMask or \u201cOurs\u201d), will simply generate critical step importance scores by sampling random values (for example, via a function like get_random_importance_scores) and then use those scores to determine the critical state resets during retraining. I would look for a clear branch (or a parameter option) in the retraining functions (such as train_rice, train_statemask_r, or in a corresponding script for autonomous driving) that allows the user to choose a \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method, as opposed to the mask network variant. The Random method should be selectable\u2014not only when computing fidelity (e.g., in fidelity.py) but also during the retraining phase so that the reset mechanism uses randomly generated critical step estimates for the autonomous driving environment.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, I see an implementation of a random explanation method in src/fidelity.py. There is a function called get_random_importance_scores which returns random values for the trajectory steps. Furthermore, the calculate_fidelity_score function uses a branch where, if no explanation policy is provided (i.e. explanation_policy is None), then it calls get_random_importance_scores to compute the importance scores. This meets the \u201cRandom\u201d Explanation method implementation for fidelity evaluation.\n\nHowever, when it comes to retraining (i.e. the core RICE refinement procedure), the code in files such as src/rice.py and src/baselines.py always loads a mask network policy via PPO.load from a provided mask_network_path. There is no evident branch that allows the user to choose the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method during retraining. For example, in train_rice (in src/rice.py) the code unconditionally loads a mask network for generating critical state guidance. In run_refinement.py the methods \u201crice\u201d and \u201cstatemask_r\u201d are used but the alternative \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method is not separately offered; only a \u201crice_nomask\u201d option exists, but that seems to imply omitting any explanation rather than using a random explanation. I found no autonomous-driving\u2013specific code that explicitly provides the option to select a random explanation method for retraining by randomly selecting visited states.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0  \nThe submitted implementation does include a random explanation option for fidelity evaluation but does not provide an option during retraining\u2014especially for the autonomous driving environment\u2014where a \u201cRandom\u201d Explanation method is selectable as required by the criterion.",

I will look for functions in the submission that implement the overall fidelity score computation, especially the parts that force random actions from a critical state and then compute the reward change metric. In addition, I expect that the code\u2019s defaults (like D_max values) may include a setting for selfish mining (and indeed the paper\u2019s addendum clarifies that the metric should be computed likewise in every environment, including selfish mining).\n\n# Reality\nThe primary implementation for the fidelity score metric is located in the file \u201csrc/fidelity.py.\u201d In that file, there is a function \u201ccalculate_fidelity_score\u201d that follows these steps:\n\u2022 It resets an environment (using gym.make(env_id)) and collects an original trajectory by running the target policy.\n\u2022 It obtains step-level importance scores via \u201cget_importance_scores\u201d if an explanation policy is provided (or uses random scores otherwise).\n\u2022 It then uses \u201cfind_critical_segment\u201d to identify the most critical segment based on a sliding window.\n\u2022 Next, it attempts to run a \u201cperturbed trajectory\u201d from that critical segment by invoking \u201crun_perturbed_trajectory,\u201d in which it resets the environment to the saved state and forces random actions for the duration of the segment.\n\u2022 Finally, it computes the reward change and uses logarithms to compute the fidelity score.\n\nThe file \u201cscripts/run_fidelity.py\u201d also shows that a DEFAULT_D_MAX dictionary includes an entry for \"SelfishMining\" (with a value of 20.0). This indicates that the experiment setup anticipates running the fidelity score calculations for the selfish mining environment by passing env_id = \u201cSelfishMining\u201d to the fidelity score functions.\n\nHowever, while the fidelity metric implementation in \u201cfidelity.py\u201d is generally correct for environments that support get_state() and set_state() (as in many MuJoCo tasks), it implicitly relies on the environment implementing get_state and set_state. The functions \u201cget_env_state\u201d and \u201cset_env_state\u201d check for these methods. If an environment\u2014such as a selfish mining environment\u2014does not provide these methods, then the code will print a warning (\u201cWarning: Env {env_id} lacks get/set_state for fidelity calculation.\u201d) and skip running the perturbed run. This means that if the selfish mining environment does not support state saving/restoration via get_state/set_state, the metric would not be properly computed.\n\nThere is no specialized code or alternative mechanism in the submission to handle the selfish mining environment in cases where get_state/set_state is missing. The implementation is generic and appears tailored to environments like those in MuJoCo, and does not show any modifications to accommodate environments (like selfish mining) which might not support such methods.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0\n\nWhile the submission includes a generally correct implementation of a fidelity score metric (in \u201cfidelity.py\u201d) that forces random actions from a critical segment and computes a score, it does not provide a specialized or verified implementation for the selfish mining environment. Specifically, if the selfish mining environment (identified by \u201cSelfishMining\u201d in the DEFAULT_D_MAX) does not support state manipulation (i.e. get_state/set_state), the implementation will print a warning and skip the perturbed run. Therefore, the submission fails to meet the criterion of correctly implementing the fidelity score metric for the selfish mining environment as detailed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.",

In the paper\u2019s Appendix C.3 and Table 4, the authors compare the efficiency of their alternative design by reporting training time (in seconds) and the number of training samples used, which implies that the code should use time\u2013measurement calls (e.g. using the time module) to log the elapsed time for training, either for the whole training process or periodically during training. I would specifically look for code that records a start time right before the training loop begins (or before .learn() is called), and then a corresponding end time after training completes, with the elapsed time computed and printed or logged.

However, upon reviewing the code, I did not find any code that explicitly measures the elapsed training time. There is no use of time() or similar time-measurement functions before and after the call to mask_model.learn(), nor is there any reporting (e.g. printing the elapsed training time) related to efficiency measurements. Although the rice.py file does make use of time.time() to measure update times for generating critical states, that code is unrelated to the specific measurement of training time for the mask network (i.e. \"StateMask\"). Similarly, the provided scripts (like scripts/train_mask.py) do not give any instructions or code that log training time information for the StateMask training run. Thus the submission does not actually implement the training time measurement functionality outlined for this criterion.\n\n# Score\n0 \u2013 The submission does not meet the criterion because it lacks any code for measuring and reporting the training time for the \"StateMask\" explanation method (as required by Appendix C.3 and Table 4).",

In practice, I would expect that the function responsible for training the mask network (the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method) wraps the call to the learning procedure (for example, calling mask_model.learn(...)) with a timer. This could be implemented by recording the start and end times (using something like time.time()) and then printing or logging the total elapsed time in seconds. This measured time is the efficiency metric that is compared in Table 4 of the paper (which shows that the \"Ours\" method achieves about a 16.8% time drop compared to StateMask). I will specifically look for code in the training functions (for instance in train_mask_network in state_mask.py and/or in train_mask.py) that uses timing functions to capture and report the duration of training.\n\n# Reality\nUpon reviewing the provided files, I examined the implementation for training the mask network in both \"state_mask.py\" (which defines the MaskNetworkPolicy and includes the function train_mask_network) and \"train_mask.py\".

It does not address the efficiency measurement for the mask network training.\n\nThus, while the code covers the training and learning of the explanation method (\u201cOurs\u201d) via the mask network, it does not implement any mechanism to measure and report the training time as required by the criterion for efficiency, as outlined in Appendix C.3 and Table 4.\n\n# Score\n0 \u2013 The submission does not contain any code that measures and logs the training time for the \"Ours\" explanation method.

This would typically involve recording the start time (for example, using time.time()) at the beginning of training and recording the end time at the end of training, then computing and possibly logging the elapsed time. The paper\u2019s Appendix C.3 and Table 4 mention that training time (and number of samples) is reported, so the implementation should include code that \u201cwraps\u201d the learning process with time measurements, ideally printing or logging that data.

In Appendix C.3 and Table 4 of the paper, the authors compare the training time (in seconds) for the mask network between their method and StateMask. To meet this criterion, the implementation should wrap the training process (or relevant portions such as the call to learn() in \u201ctrain_mask_network\u201d) with time measurements (e.g., using time.time()) to record the start and end times of training, and then log or print the elapsed time.

This function sets up the PPO model and starts training by calling \u201cmask_model.learn(\u2026)\u201d with a custom callback (\u201cSimpleProgressCallback\u201d) that prints the percentage of progress in terms of steps.

However, that section is related to the overall refinement process and measuring the time to update critical states\u2014not to the training time of the StateMask mask network. There is no specific time measurement for the mask network training that could be used to report efficiency as required for the autonomous driving environment.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0\n\nThe submission does not implement code to measure and report the training time of the StateMask explanation method (i.e., the training time for the mask network) as outlined in Appendix C.3 and Table 4 for the autonomous driving environment.

However, there is no explicit code that records the training start time and end time (for example, using `time.time()`) to compute and log the total training time. \n- In **src/rice.py**, there is a callback (`RICECallback`) that measures the time for updating critical states (using `start_time = time.time()` and printing the elapsed time for the critical state update). However, this pertains to the critical state update process in the RICE framework and not to the training time of the explanation method (mask network) itself.\n- None of the other files (e.g., the fidelity or the baseline-related scripts) include any explicit timing measurements that would log or output total training time for the mask network training.\n- There is no indication that any environment-specific (e.g., autonomous driving) adaptation of the mask network training logs is made regarding training time. The logging for training progress only shows steps and percentage completed.\n\nThus, although the submission includes implementations of the explanation method and training functions, it does not implement explicit measurement of training time throughout the training process in the way outlined for Table 4 and Appendix C.3.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0  \nThe submission does not include code that explicitly measures and logs the training time for the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method (mask network training) as required by the criterion.

Its _reset_env method implements the following logic:\n\u2003 \u2013 It generates a random number and, if that number is less than self.p_critical and a critical state is available for that environment (self.critical_states[env_idx] is not None), it attempts to restore the environment to that critical state via the set_state method.\n\u2003 \u2013 Otherwise, it falls back to the normal environment reset (calling the environment\u2019s \u201creset\u201d method via env_method).\nThis clearly implements a probabilistic reset that mixes default initial states with critical states based on the provided probability parameter.\n\u2022 Further, in \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d, the RICECallback\u2019s _update_critical_states method generates new critical states by running a rollout using the target policy and the mask network (the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method). It computes importance scores (using 1 minus the mask probability) to identify the critical state within a trajectory and then updates the critical state list within the CriticalStateResetWrapper via its set_critical_states method.\n\u2022 In the train_rice function (also in \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d), the environment is wrapped by first applying CriticalStateResetWrapper (with parameter p_critical) and then by a RNDRewardWrapper. This ensures that when the environment resets during training, it uses the mixed distribution (default reset vs. critical state) as required.\nOverall, the code in the submission clearly provides a concrete implementation for constructing a mixed initial state distribution specifically for MuJoCo environments. It uses the parameter p_critical to govern the mixture and uses the explanation method (via MaskNetworkPolicy) to identify and update critical states.\n\n# Score\n1 \u2013 The submission meets the requirements. The code (in \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d, particularly in the CriticalStateResetWrapper and RICECallback classes) correctly implements a mixed initial state distribution by probabilistically resetting to critical states (identified by the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method) and to default initial states, as described in Section 3.3.",

This matches the intended functionality of probabilistically mixing default initial states with critical states as explained in the paper.\nFurthermore, in the script \u201cscripts/run_refinement.py\u201d, there is a command-line argument `--p-critical` that overrides the default value contained in the dictionary `DEFAULT_RICE_PARAMS`. This demonstrates that the hyperparameter is mutable via configuration and does not require code editing to change its value.\nThus, the submission provides a mutable hyperparameter (named \u201cp_critical\u201d, which is acceptable as an alternative name) that governs the probability threshold for selecting critical states during refinement in MuJoCo environments.\n\n# Score\n1\n\nThe submission meets the criterion because it correctly implements and exposes the tunable hyperparameter (`p_critical`) that defines the mixed initial state distribution, exactly as required by the paper and the criterion.",

Although the code is generic (i.e., it is not restricted only to the selfish mining environment), it is intended to be used with any environment \u2013 including the selfish mining environment \u2013 as long as the environment id is provided correctly.\n\nThus, the train_statemask_r function, together with the supporting critical state reset mechanism, exactly implements the StateMask fine-tuning (StateMask-R) approach as required.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submission meets the criterion since it includes a dedicated implementation for StateMask-R (in \"baselines.py\" via the train_statemask_r function and in \"rice.py\" via the CriticalStateResetWrapper) that resets the environment to the identified critical states (p=1) and fine-tunes the agent accordingly, as outlined in section 4.1 and Cheng et al., 2023.",

We expect to see:\n\u2022 A definition of the RND networks \u2013 one fixed target network with frozen parameters and one trainable predictor network \u2013 built typically as MLPs.\n\u2022 A method that computes an MSE loss (or squared difference) between the output embeddings of the target and predictor networks given a next state.\n\u2022 An environment wrapper (or equivalent integration) that uses this computed loss to generate an intrinsic exploration bonus, multiplied by a hyperparameter \u03bb, and adds it to the extrinsic reward.\n\u2022 Normalization components (e.g. observation normalizer, reward normalizer) may also be included.\nI will specifically look for these components in the submission\u2019s source code, expecting that the RND modules are integrated into the overall refinement pipeline in a way that matches the paper\u2019s Section 3.3.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission includes a file \u201csrc/rnd.py\u201d that defines RND functionality.

I expect to see a wrapper (or similar mechanism) responsible for probabilistic resets to critical states (i.e., the mixed distribution).\n2. An exploration bonus based on Random Network Distillation (RND) that modifies the environment's rewards. I expect to see code that computes the intrinsic RND reward (using an RND network, observation normalizer, and reward normalizer) and then adds it to the extrinsic reward.\n\nFurthermore, the refining function should tie these components together. It should wrap the environment using both the mixed reset (critical state) mechanism and the RND reward augmentation, then use a reinforcement learning (e.g., PPO) training call to refine the agent based on these modified conditions. There should be actual code implementing these wrappers and a training function (for example, called \u201ctrain_rice\u201d) that integrates them.\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the submission files reveals the following:\n\n1. In \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d, the function `train_rice` is implemented. It clearly sets up the refining procedure by:\n   - Loading the target (pre-trained) policy and the mask (explanation) policy.\n   - Creating a vectorized environment with `make_vec_env`.\n   - Setting up RND by instantiating an `RNDObservationNormalizer`, an `RNDRewardNormalizer`, and the `RNDNetworks` class implemented in \u201csrc/rnd.py\u201d.\n   - Wrapping the base environment with a `CriticalStateResetWrapper` which is intended to implement the mixed initial state distribution. This wrapper uses a probability threshold (`p_critical`) to decide whether to reset an environment to a previously stored critical state (as per the paper\u2019s description).\n   - Further wrapping the environment with an `RNDRewardWrapper` which computes an intrinsic exploration reward (using the RND network) and adds it (multiplied by `lambda_intrinsic`) to the extrinsic reward.\n   - Creating a new PPO model for the refined agent. It loads weights from the pre-trained policy to initialize the refined policy.\n   - Instantiating a `RICECallback` which is responsible for training the RND predictor network and for periodically updating the critical states.\n   - Lastly, the training call to `rice_model.learn(...)` is commented out (likely due to execution constraints), but the implementation steps are clearly present.\n\n2. The file \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d also contains the implementation of two important wrappers:\n   - `CriticalStateResetWrapper`: This class wraps a vectorized environment and implements probabilistic resets based on stored critical states. It uses the method `_reset_env` to decide whether to reset an environment to a critical state (if available and if the random condition meets `p_critical`).\n   - `RNDRewardWrapper`: This class wraps the environment to add an intrinsic reward computed by the RND network to the original rewards. This is done in its `step_wait` method.\n\n3. The RND components are implemented in \u201csrc/rnd.py\u201d where both the predictor and target networks (`RNDNetworks`) along with normalizers (`RNDObservationNormalizer` and `RNDRewardNormalizer`) are provided.\n\nTogether, these components match the requirements specified by the criterion. The code is not merely descriptive; it contains concrete implementations of:\n- Mixed initial state distribution via the critical state reset wrapper.\n- An RND-based exploration bonus via both the RNDRewardWrapper and associated RND network and normalizers.\n- An integrated refining method in `train_rice` that ties these parts together into the PPO training loop.\n\nWhile the submission does not provide environment-specific experiments for selfish mining explicitly, the refining method is implemented in a generic way that should hold for any environment, including selfish mining, as long as the environment supports state resets. The focus is on the refining method in Algorithm 2, and its integration via these wrappers is clearly evident.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1. \n\nThe submission clearly implements the refining method as specified in the criterion: it integrates a mixed initial state distribution (using the CriticalStateResetWrapper) and RND (via the RNDRewardWrapper, RNDNetworks, and callbacks) within the `train_rice` method. The code reflects the intended functionality outlined in Algorithm 2.",

Its docstring reads \u201cFine-tunes using PPO, resetting ONLY to critical states (p=1, lambda=0)\u201d. The function loads a target policy and a mask policy (using the helper load_policy), wraps the environment with a \u201cCriticalStateResetWrapper\u201d with p_critical set to 1.0 (ensuring that resets will always use the identified critical states), and then proceeds to fine-tune the policy with PPO using this wrapped environment.\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d, the class \u201cCriticalStateResetWrapper\u201d is implemented. It checks, for each environment instance, whether a critical state is available and, with a probability p (set to 1.0 in the StateMask-R case), resets to that critical state. This aligns with the expected behavior of resetting to the identified critical states.\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d, the \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d class is defined, and it includes a method \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d that computes the probability for the blinding (mask) action. This is used to generate the importance scores that ultimately guide the selection of the critical state.\nWhile the submission does not include a file explicitly labeled for a \u201cnetwork defence environment,\u201d the overall implementation is generic. The StateMask-R approach (i.e., resetting to critical states and continuing training) is encapsulated in the \u201ctrain_statemask_r\u201d function and the reset wrapper. Since the network defence environment was listed among the environments to be tested (and given previous criteria indicate that environments have been set up), this generic implementation is expected to be used for the network defence environment as well.\n\n# Score\nI assign a score of 1. The submission contains a correct implementation of StateMask fine-tuning (StateMask-R) as evidenced by the \u201ctrain_statemask_r\u201d function in \u201csrc/baselines.py\u201d, the implementation of the \u201cCriticalStateResetWrapper\u201d in \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d, and the explanation method implemented in \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d. These components together correctly reset the environment to the identified critical states and continue training, meeting the stated criterion.",

This wrapper extends VecEnvWrapper and overloads the reset behavior. In its _reset_env method, the code checks: \"if random.random() < self.p_critical and self.critical_states[env_idx] is not None\", in which case it uses the stored critical state (assumed to be in the form (qpos, qvel) for MuJoCo environments) to reset the environment by calling set_state. Otherwise, it falls back to the default environment reset procedure.\n\nIn addition, in the train_rice function (also in \"src/rice.py\"), the environment is wrapped using CriticalStateResetWrapper\u2014this indicates that during training the initial state is indeed chosen from a mixed distribution as described (with probability p_critical to use the critical state and otherwise using the default). The critical states themselves are updated in the RICECallback (also defined in \"src/rice.py\") by evaluating the target policy\u2019s trajectory using the MaskNetworkPolicy\u2019s predict_mask_prob method to identify important (critical) steps. Although the code is written in a generic fashion (applicable to any environment supporting state saving/loading), it is meant to be used, for example, in the network defence environment. Thus, it satisfies the requirement to construct a mixed initial state distribution by combining default initial states with critical states as identified by the \"Ours\" explanation method.\n\n# Score\n1 \u2013 The submission meets the criterion. The code provided (specifically in the CriticalStateResetWrapper and its integration in train_rice) correctly implements the mixed initial state distribution mechanism described in Section 3.3, where environments are reset probabilistically to either a default initial state or to a critical state identified by the explanation method.",

In particular, I would look for:\n\u2022 A mechanism to create a mixed initial state distribution by combining default resets with resets to \u201ccritical states\u201d (i.e. resets using states identified by the explanation method). This is typically done by a reset wrapper that, with a probability p (p_critical), resets the environment to a saved critical state and otherwise does a standard environment reset.\n\u2022 Integration of an exploration bonus using Random Network Distillation (RND). This means that aside from the standard extrinsic reward, an RND module (with networks, observation and reward normalizers) is used to compute an intrinsic reward which is then added (scaled by a lambda factor) to the extrinsic reward.\n\u2022 I expect these components to be combined in the primary refinement training function (e.g., \u201ctrain_rice\u201d) such that the environment is wrapped with both the \u201cCriticalStateResetWrapper\u201d (for the mixed initial state distribution) and the \u201cRNDRewardWrapper\u201d (for RND bonus), and that the PPO training on this wrapped environment implements the full refining method as described.\n\n# Reality\nUpon reviewing the submission files:\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d, the function \u201ctrain_rice\u201d is clearly implemented. It first creates a vectorized environment (using make_vec_env) and then wraps it using \u201cCriticalStateResetWrapper\u201d with a parameter p_critical. Within this wrapper (defined in the same file) the reset method probabilistically chooses to load a critical state (when available) or to use the default environment reset\u2014fulfilling the \u201cmixed initial state distribution\u201d requirement.\n\u2022 Immediately following that, the environment is further wrapped with \u201cRNDRewardWrapper\u201d (also defined in \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d). This wrapper applies the RND logic; it uses the RND networks, observation normalizer, and reward normalizer (implemented in \u201csrc/rnd.py\u201d) to compute an intrinsic reward bonus. The intrinsic reward is combined (via the lambda_intrinsic scaling factor) with the extrinsic reward.\n\u2022 Additionally, \u201cRICECallback\u201d in \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d is set up to update critical states and train the RND predictor network during refinement.\n\u2022 Together, these pieces in \u201ctrain_rice\u201d integrate both the mixed initial state distribution and RND, as required by Algorithm 2. Although the code is generic and environment-agnostic, it is designed to be used with any gym environment \u2013 including the network defence environment\u2014so it meets the criterion for that environment.\n\u2022 The other files (e.g., \u201csrc/rnd.py\u201d and \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d) support these functionalities. There is clear evidence that (a) a mixed distribution reset (via CriticalStateResetWrapper) is implemented and (b) RND-based exploration is integrated (via RNDRewardWrapper and related RND classes).\n\n# Score\nI award a score of 1. The submission includes a correct implementation of the refining method for the network defence environment as outlined in Algorithm 2. The code in \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d properly integrates both the mixed initial state distribution (via the CriticalStateResetWrapper) and the RND bonus (via the RNDRewardWrapper and associated RND modules), thereby meeting the resolution criterion.",

In the file \"src/rice.py\", the function `train_rice()` accepts a parameter named `lambda_intrinsic` (a float) that clearly governs the relative weight of the exploration bonus.

Additionally, the run scripts (for example, \"scripts/run_hyperparams.py\" and \"scripts/run_refinement.py\") accept command-line arguments that include specification of lambda values (e.g. via the flag \"--lambda-values\" in one script and \"--lambda-intrinsic\" in another), confirming that this hyperparameter is mutable externally and not hardcoded.

In addition, the \u201cscripts/run_refinement.py\u201d file shows that the submission attempts to run multiple refinement methods \u2013 one of which is \u201cppo_finetune\u201d, which would internally call the implementation in train_ppo_finetune.\n\n# Score\nI award a score of 1. The submission includes a clear and correct implementation of the PPO fine-tuning refinement method as required. Despite the training calls being commented out (likely due to resource constraints), the code exists, sets a lowered learning rate, and is designed to continue training with PPO, which meets the criterion.",

In this method the environment is reset to \u201ccritical states\u201d identified by the explanation (via StateMask), and training is continued from these states using PPO. The implementation should use a reset mechanism (for example, a wrapper) that forces training to restart from the critical states (and with parameters \u201cp=1, lambda=0\u201d as described). I would specifically look for a function or module that resets the state of the environment to the critical state as identified by the mask policy and then resumes training\u2014likely referenced as something like \u201ctrain_statemask_r\u201d or a resetting wrapper\u2014and this code should be applicable (or at least parameterizable) to the autonomous driving environment.\n\n# Reality  \nIn the submission, I find in the file \u201csrc/baselines.py\u201d a function named \u201ctrain_statemask_r\u201d. Its docstring states:  \n\u2003\u2003\"Fine-tunes using PPO, resetting ONLY to critical states (p=1, lambda=0).\"  \nThis function loads both the target (pretrained) policy and the mask network policy using the helper \u201cload_policy\u201d. It then sets up the environment with a call to \u201cmake_vec_env\u201d and wraps it using \u201cCriticalStateResetWrapper\u201d (from the \u201crice.py\u201d file) with p_critical set to 1.0. This wrapper is exactly what is expected to perform the reset to the identified critical states. After wrapping, the function then sets up a PPO model using the wrapped environment and proceeds with the fine-tuning procedure. Although the implementation is generic (i.e. it accepts an \u201cenv_id\u201d parameter), this design implies that if one provides an autonomous driving environment id and the corresponding configuration, the same \u201ctrain_statemask_r\u201d function will carry out the fine-tuning as expected under the StateMask-R strategy. Additionally, the \u201cstate_mask.py\u201d file defines the \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d class used in this process, ensuring that the explanation method output (i.e. critical states) is available.  \n\nOverall, the submission contains actual code that implements the reset-to-critical-states mechanism followed by continued training, which is the core of the StateMask-R approach.

In code, I would look for an environment wrapper or reset function that, based on a mixing probability parameter (often denoted as p or p_critical), uses a random choice to either load a stored critical state (using state\u2010setting functions, e.g. set_state) or to perform a standard reset.

Although the code is general and applies to all supported environments, when used with the autonomous driving environment the same mechanism will construct a mixed initial state distribution: with probability p_critical the environment starts at a critical state, and with probability (1 \u2013 p_critical) it starts at its default initial state.

A correct implementation should include the following components:\n- A target network (randomly initialized and frozen) and a predictor network (trainable) that are typically implemented as multilayer perceptrons.\n- A method for computing the intrinsic reward as the mean-squared error (or similar difference metric) between the predictor\u2019s output and the target\u2019s output given the next observation.\n- Routines for normalizing observation inputs and intrinsic rewards (i.e., observation and reward normalizers).\n- Integration of the intrinsic RND reward into the overall reward signal (scaled by a hyperparameter \u03bb) so that the agent is encouraged to explore novel states.\n- Code that is incorporated into the training pipeline\u2014specifically in the RICE algorithm\u2014as a reward wrapper or similar so that when training in any environment (including the autonomous driving environment) the exploration bonus is applied.\n\nI will look for classes or functions (e.g., \u201cRNDNetworks\u201d, \u201cRNDRewardNormalizer\u201d, \u201cRNDObservationNormalizer\u201d, and a reward wrapper that adds the intrinsic reward) and evidence that the intrinsic reward is computed and used in the environment\u2019s reward signal.\n\n# Reality\nAfter reviewing the provided files, I found the following relevant implementations:\n\n1. **src/rnd.py:**\n   - The file defines a class named \u201cRNDNetworks\u201d which constructs both a target network and a predictor network using an MLP (with a default architecture of [64, 64] if none is provided). The target network\u2019s parameters are correctly frozen.\n   - The \u201ccompute_loss\u201d method in RNDNetworks computes the mean squared error between the predictor\u2019s output and that of the target network over the input \u201cnext_obs\u201d tensor, which matches the expected RND intrinsic reward calculation.\n   - The file also includes \u201cRNDRewardNormalizer\u201d and \u201cRNDObservationNormalizer\u201d classes. These classes serve to normalize the intrinsic rewards and the observations, respectively, which is a necessary component of RND implementations to handle reward scaling and stability.\n\n2. **src/rice.py:**\n   - Within this file, I found the \u201cRNDRewardWrapper\u201d class that wraps a VecEnv and incorporates RND in its \u201cstep_wait\u201d method. The wrapper converts observations to a tensor, normalizes them using the observation normalizer, and then computes the RND loss (intrinsic reward) using the \u201ccompute_loss\u201d method from RNDNetworks.\n   - The intrinsic reward (after normalization) is then combined with the extrinsic reward via a scaling factor (\u03bb, passed as \u201clambda_intrinsic\u201d), according to the formula:\n     combined_rewards = rewards + lambda_intrinsic * normalized_intrinsic_rewards\n   - This integration effectively augments the agent\u2019s reward signal with the RND-based exploration bonus, as required.\n\nOverall, while the code is generic and not tied solely to an autonomous driving environment, it is clearly intended to be used in any environment (including autonomous driving) with RND for exploration as part of the RICE training framework. The submitted files correctly provide the implementation of RND that aligns with Section 3.3.\n\n# Score\nI award a score of 1 to this submission for the criterion. The implementation of Random Network Distillation is clearly present in the \"src/rnd.py\" file and is properly integrated into the training pipeline via the \"RNDRewardWrapper\" in \"src/rice.py\". These components correctly compute and apply the intrinsic reward, fulfilling the requirement for the autonomous driving environment and other environments as outlined in the paper.",

In particular, the correct implementation should integrate two key components:  \n1. A mechanism for constructing a mixed initial state distribution by resetting the environment not only from the default initial state but also from critical states identified by the explanation method (e.g. via a reset wrapper or similar logic).  \n2. Integration of an exploration incentive using Random Network Distillation (RND) that computes an intrinsic reward (added to the extrinsic reward) to promote exploration.  \n\nI expect to see classes or wrappers (or equivalent functions) that explicitly implement these components\u2014for example, something like a \u201cCriticalStateResetWrapper\u201d (or similar) that probabilistically resets to a critical state, and an \u201cRNDRewardWrapper\u201d (or RND network and reward normalizer code) that adds the RND bonus to rewards. These should then be integrated into the overall training (refinement) loop, for instance by using PPO with a callback to update critical states. Although the paper targets the autonomous driving environment specifically, the implementation may be generic but should work when the appropriate environment (e.g. one corresponding to autonomous driving) is passed in.\n\n# Reality  \nReviewing the provided submission files, the core implementation for the RICE refining method is found primarily in the file \"src/rice.py.\" In this file, the function \"train_rice\" implements the overall refining pipeline. Key observations include:  \n- **Mixed Initial State Distribution:**  \n  The code wraps the environment using \"CriticalStateResetWrapper,\" which is designed to reset individual environments to previously identified critical states with a probability given by `p_critical`. This is how the submission implements the \u201cmixed\u201d initial state distribution, combining default resets with resets to critical states identified through an explanation method via a mask network.  \n- **Integration of RND:**  \n  Immediately after, the environment is wrapped with \"RNDRewardWrapper.\" This wrapper computes an intrinsic reward using RND\u2014calling functions from the RND implementation in \"src/rnd.py\" (which defines `RNDNetworks`, `RNDObservationNormalizer`, and `RNDRewardNormalizer`)\u2014and adds this bonus, scaled by a parameter (`lambda_intrinsic`), to the extrinsic reward. This matches the RND exploration component outlined in the paper.  \n- **Callback and Integration:**  \n  The implementation further defines a callback, \u201cRICECallback,\u201d which periodically updates the recording of critical states by using the mask network (from \"src/state_mask.py\") and also trains the RND predictor network. These components are then fed into a PPO model for training.  \n- **Applicability to Autonomous Driving:**  \n  Although the code is written in a generic fashion (i.e. \u201cenv_id\u201d is passed as a parameter), it is fully compatible with any environment including an autonomous driving environment. The integration of both mixed state resets and RND for exploration is present, which is key to the autonomous driving refining method as described in Algorithm\u00a02.\n\nThus, the submission includes actual code that implements the refining method with a mixed initial state approach and RND, as required.\n\n# Score  \nI award a score of 1. The submission contains a correct implementation of the refining method as outlined in Algorithm\u00a02\u2014it integrates a mixed initial state distribution (via the \"CriticalStateResetWrapper\") and RND for exploration (via the \"RNDRewardWrapper\" and accompanying RND code) which are then used in the overall training process defined in \"train_rice\" in \"src/rice.py.\" This meets the criterion for the autonomous driving environment refining method\u2014even though the code is written generally, it will work properly for the autonomous driving environment when used with the proper environment settings.",

Specifically, the code should load and use the custom \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d (which implements the optimized StateMask with its adjustments, such as using a reward bonus and a modified training process) when refining the pretrained agent. This means that in the refinement pipeline (for example, in the RICE training function within the rice.py module), there should be code that loads the mask network using something like PPO.load with a custom_objects dictionary specifying MaskNetworkPolicy, and then uses its method (such as predict_mask_prob) to compute step\u2010level importance scores. The critical state selection processes (as outlined in the paper) should use these scores (e.g. computing \u201c1 \u2013 mask probability\u201d) to decide which states are critical. I will look for these code components in the submission (in files like src/state_mask.py and src/rice.py) and check that they are indeed used within the \u201cOurs\u201d refinement method implementation, as opposed to using a random or alternative baseline explanation.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, the implementation is clearly present:\n\u2022 In the file src/state_mask.py, there is a class \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d which inherits from ActorCriticPolicy. This class implements the method \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d that computes the probability for the masking action using the policy\u2019s latent outputs. The method subtracts the probability for action 1 (blinding) from 1 in order to yield the importance score\u2014effectively realizing the optimized \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.\n\u2022 In the file src/rice.py (which contains the RICE training function for the refinement method), the code first loads the mask network by calling PPO.load with a custom_objects argument specifying MaskNetworkPolicy. The loaded \u201cmask_policy\u201d is then passed to the RICECallback. Inside RICECallback (also defined in src/rice.py), the callback calls \u201cself.mask_policy.predict_mask_prob(states_np)\u201d on the evaluated trajectory states and calculates the importance scores as \u201c1.0 \u2013 probs\u201d. This is exactly the mechanism described in the paper for the optimized StateMask explanation.\n\u2022 Additionally, in src/fidelity.py, the function get_importance_scores calls the \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d method from the mask policy (expected to be of type MaskNetworkPolicy) and then computes \u201c1.0 \u2013 prob_blind\u201d to obtain the step-level importance scores. This shows that when evaluating fidelity (as in Experiment I), the optimized explanation method is used.\n\u2022 The scripts for running refinement experiments (for instance, scripts/run_refinement.py) include choices for different methods, and when \u201crice\u201d or \u201crice_nomask\u201d is selected (corresponding to the \u201cOurs\u201d method), the code calls train_rice with a mask network path and indeed uses the MaskNetworkPolicy. \n\nThus, I see that the submission has several modules that load and use the optimized StateMask explanation as part of its \u201cOurs\u201d refinement method implementation for the MuJoCo environments.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1.

In practice, this might be implemented by accumulating rewards over each episode (by summing the rewards returned from each step) and then logging or outputting these cumulative rewards (for example, via a callback, logging statement, or saving to a file). I would specifically look for code in the refinement-related files (such as in the RICE training function, its associated callback, or within the PPO learning loop) that shows a variable accumulating reward over time and then printing/logging the cumulative reward value during training.\n\n# Reality\nLooking through the submission files:\n- In \"src/fidelity.py\" there is code such as in the function \"run_perturbed_trajectory\" that accumulates a variable called \"total_reward_perturbed\" by summing rewards along a trajectory. However, this code is part of the fidelity evaluation and not part of the refinement loop for Experiment II.\n- In \"src/rice.py\", which implements the RICE training procedure for the \"Ours\" method, I see a function \"train_rice\" that sets up the environment, loads the policies, and instantiates the PPO model. There is also a \"RICECallback\" class that is used during refinement. However, in both \"train_rice\" and in RICECallback, while there is logging of metrics such as \"rollout/intrinsic_reward_mean\" and \"rollout/critical_reset_rate,\" there is no explicit calculation or logging of the cumulative (episode) reward throughout refinement. Moreover, the actual PPO training calls (i.e. rice_model.learn(...)) are commented out, so no runtime tracking of cumulative reward is visible.\n- In \"src/baselines.py\" the baseline functions (e.g., train_ppo_finetune and train_statemask_r) also set up refinement but do not explicitly include code to measure cumulative reward during the refinement process.\n\nThus, while the code has mechanisms to calculate rewards (as required for reinforcement learning in general), I do not see any specific code that is implemented solely for measuring and reporting the cumulative reward during the refinement phase for the \"Ours\" method in Experiment II for MuJoCo. Instead, the reward measurement seems implicit in the RL learning process and any logging would be carried out by the standard PPO/TensorBoard logging rather than by custom code written specifically for cumulative reward measurement.\n\n# Score\n0. The submission does not include any specific code that measures cumulative reward throughout refinement. Although reward values are accumulated within a fidelity evaluation function and standard PPO training may log reward metrics automatically, there is no explicit implementation in the refinement-specific (RICE) code that tracks and reports cumulative reward as required by the criterion.",

In practice this means that the code for the refinement method should load and employ a mask network using the custom policy class (e.g. \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d) that implements the optimized explanation method described in the paper. I will look for a function (e.g., train_statemask_r in the baselines module) where the mask network is loaded with a parameter like custom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy and then used to extract the step\u2010level importance scores. The implementation in the file(s) related to the StateMask component (here, state_mask.py) should clearly implement the \u201cOurs\u201d version (e.g. with an appropriate predict_mask_prob method) rather than a random or non\u2010optimized version.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, the file \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d defines the class \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy.\u201d This class overrides the method predict_mask_prob (which is used to compute the probability of the blind action on a given observation), and the code in \u201csrc/fidelity.py\u201d actually uses this by computing importance_scores = 1.0 - prob_blind. This matches the description of the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.\nFurthermore, in \u201csrc/baselines.py\u201d there is the function train_statemask_r which is responsible for the StateMask-R refinement. In this function, the mask network is loaded via:\n\u2003\u2003mask_policy_obj = load_policy(mask_network_path, 'PPO', custom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy)\nThis call ensures that the optimized mask network (i.e. \u201cOurs\u201d) is used when running the StateMask-R refinement method.\nThere is no alternative fallback code that uses a random explanation or a non-optimized method for StateMask-R. The provided code clearly uses the custom MaskNetworkPolicy class, meeting the expected resolution.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submission meets the criterion because the StateMask-R refinement method (implemented in train_statemask_r in \u201csrc/baselines.py\u201d) correctly loads and uses the optimized explanation method implemented in the \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d class (in \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d) as required for Experiment II in the MuJoCo environments.",

Concretely, when running the RICE refinement routine, the implementation must load a mask network whose policy class is the optimized variant (implemented as MaskNetworkPolicy in the state_mask.py module) via a mechanism such as providing a custom_objects parameter when loading a PPO model (or similar). In addition, the refinement training callback (RICECallback in rice.py) should use this mask policy to compute importance scores (via a method such as predict_mask_prob) when updating critical states. I will look for code that (a) imports and uses MaskNetworkPolicy from the state_mask module and (b) ensures that when the \u201cOurs\u201d method is selected for refinement on selfish mining, the customized, optimized explanation method is used.\n\n# Reality\nLooking through the submission:\n- In \"src/state_mask.py,\" the class MaskNetworkPolicy is defined. It is clearly an ActorCriticPolicy that is modified for a discrete mask action-space and implements the function predict_mask_prob \u2013 which returns the probability of taking the blinding action. This is the optimized explanation method (the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation) described in the paper.\n- In \"src/rice.py,\" within the function train_rice, the code explicitly loads the mask network using the line:\n  \u2009\n  mask_model = PPO.load(mask_network_path, device=device_load, custom_objects={'policy_class': MaskNetworkPolicy})\n  \n  This shows that the code explicitly uses the MaskNetworkPolicy (i.e. the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method) when setting up RICE.\n- In \"scripts/run_refinement.py,\" the DEFAULT_RICE_PARAMS dictionary includes an entry for \"SelfishMining\" with parameters appropriate to that environment. Additionally, the run_refinement script is set up to run various methods (including \u201crice\u201d), which\u2014if run for the selfish mining environment\u2014will use train_rice. Therefore, when the environment is selfish mining and the method \u201crice\u201d is chosen (i.e., the \u201cOurs\u201d refinement method), the code correctly loads and uses the MaskNetworkPolicy as the explanation method.\n  \nThus, the submission shows that the optimized state mask (the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method) is used during refinement for selfish mining via the proper loading and use of MaskNetworkPolicy in the RICE training function.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submission meets the criterion. The refined method for the selfish mining environment is implemented in the RICE training code, and it correctly loads the optimized explanation method (MaskNetworkPolicy from state_mask.py) via the custom_objects argument when loading the mask model. This directly addresses the requirement that the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method be used in Experiment II for the selfish mining environment.",

Additionally, since this criterion focuses on the selfish mining environment in Experiment II with the \"Ours\" method (which is the RICE-based refinement), I expect that within the refinement code (and specifically in the parts of the RICE implementation) there will be explicit measurement or logging of the cumulative rewards (or a similar metric) across the refinement phase. I will look in files implementing the refinement method (likely in rice.py and associated callbacks) for functions that sum up or record the rewards per episode/rollout, and any code that is specific when running the selfish mining case.\n\n# Reality\nUpon reviewing the submission files, particularly \"rice.py\" and \"baselines.py\" which implement the refinement methods (the \"Ours\" method is implemented in rice.py), I see that:\n\n\u2022 In \"rice.py\", the function \u201ctrain_rice\u201d sets up the refinement process, which builds an environment, creates the PPO model for refinement, and sets up the callback \u201cRICECallback.\u201d However, in the RICECallback implementation, the _on_step() method only logs two pieces of information: the \u201crollout/intrinsic_reward_mean\u201d (derived from the last intrinsic rewards of the RNDRewardWrapper) and the \u201crollout/critical_reset_rate.\u201d There is no explicit logging or measurement of the cumulative (or episodic) reward accumulated during the refinement process.\n\n\u2022 I did not find any specific code\u2014whether in rice.py, baselines.py, or any experiment script\u2014that aggregates and records the total (cumulative) reward of each episode during the refinement. Although Stable Baselines3\u2019s PPO may log standard metrics like \u201cep_rew_mean\u201d automatically, there is no additional code in the submission that explicitly implements or ensures measurement of cumulative reward throughout refinement, nor is there any branch of code that checks for the selfish mining environment case.\n\n\u2022 In the other files (such as fidelity.py, run_hyperparams.py, run_refinement.py) there is code for other aspects such as fidelity scoring and hyperparameter testing. They do not include sections for measuring cumulative rewards across the refinement runs for selfish mining.\n\nThus, the submission does not contain explicit code to measure cumulative reward throughout the refinement process, as required for the \"Ours\" method in the selfish mining environment in Experiment II.\n\n# Score\n0. The submission lacks an explicit implementation that measures or logs the cumulative reward during refinement for the selfish mining environment for the \"Ours\" method. While other parts of the code implement aspects of the RICE framework, there is no code specifically dedicated to tracking cumulative reward metrics during refinement, so this criterion is not met.",

I will look for the following:\n\u2022 In the code for the StateMask\u2010R refinement method (likely inside a baseline\u2019s training function), the mask network must be loaded with a custom policy class corresponding to the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.\n\u2022 In our submission, the optimized explanation method is implemented in the file \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d as the class \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy.\u201d\n\u2022 The StateMask-R refinement training code (for example, in the function train_statemask_r in \u201csrc/baselines.py\u201d) should call load_policy with custom_policy_class set to MaskNetworkPolicy.\n\u2022 I will check that this implementation is used for the selfish mining environment (which may be specified via the environment id or parameters within the refinement experiment code).\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, I found:\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/state_mask.py,\u201d a class MaskNetworkPolicy is defined. Its predict_mask_prob method returns the probability of taking the \u201cblind\u201d action in a way that aligns with the optimized (\u201cOurs\u201d) explanation method described in the paper.\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/baselines.py,\u201d the function train_statemask_r (which implements the StateMask-R refinement method) is present. In its \u201cLoading policies\u2026\u201d section it does the following:\n\u2003\u2003target_policy_obj = load_policy(pretrained_policy_path, pretrained_algo.upper())\n\u2003\u2003mask_policy_obj = load_policy(mask_network_path, 'PPO', custom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy)\nThis indicates that the optimized MaskNetworkPolicy from \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d is used to load the mask network. Although the code is generic (the same implementation is used irrespective of environment), the default RICE parameters in \u201cscripts/run_refinement.py\u201d include a block for \u201cSelfishMining\u201d (e.g., in DEFAULT_RICE_PARAMS) so that if the selfish mining environment is used, the same function (train_statemask_r) will be called with the mask network obtained via MaskNetworkPolicy.\n\u2022 There is no separate code branch or fallback here that would revert to a vanilla or random explanation; the custom_policy_class is explicitly set to MaskNetworkPolicy. This meets the paper\u2019s claim that the optimized (\u201cOurs\u201d) explanation method is being used for the StateMask-R refinement method.\n\nThus, the submission shows that the refined \u201cStateMask-R\u201d training uses the optimized mask network (the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method) by loading it via MaskNetworkPolicy, exactly as expected.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1\n\nThe submission meets the criterion because the code for the StateMask-R refinement method (in src/baselines.py) correctly loads the mask network using MaskNetworkPolicy (from src/state_mask.py) by specifying custom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy. This demonstrates that the optimized (\u201cOurs\u201d) explanation method is used in Experiment II for the selfish mining environment, satisfying the resolution criteria.",

This means that instead of the baseline PPO fine-tuning approach simply continuing training with PPO (without any explanatory resets or augmented initial states), the code should integrate the optimized version of the StateMask explanation mechanism. In our evaluation, I would look for the following:\n\u2022 Code that loads and utilizes the mask network (implemented in state_mask.py and referenced via MaskNetworkPolicy) within the PPO fine-tuning process.\n\u2022 When running PPO fine-tuning in the selfish mining environment, the code should ensure that the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation (i.e. the optimized StateMask) is used to guide the refinement (for example, by utilizing its predictions or resetting states accordingly) rather than a random or baseline explanation.\n\u2022 In the files corresponding to refinement (e.g., baselines.py or run_refinement.py), I would expect that the PPO fine-tuning function either directly uses or is parameterized to use the \u201cOurs\u201d version of the mask network.\n\n# Reality\nLooking at the submission\u2019s files:\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/baselines.py\u201d, the function `train_ppo_finetune` is defined for PPO fine-tuning. However, this function simply loads a pretrained PPO (or SAC) model and sets it to continue training via PPO. There is no reference to any explanation module or the optimized mask network. It does not load or use the MaskNetworkPolicy and hence does not use the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.\n\u2022 The file \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d implements the MaskNetworkPolicy (the optimized StateMask explanation method). This file is present, but its functionality is not integrated into the PPO fine-tuning pipeline \u2013 it is instead used in `train_statemask_r` (the StateMask-R method) and in the RICE method in \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d.\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/run_refinement.py\u201d, the script instantiates multiple refinement methods (including \u201crice\u201d, \u201cppo_finetune\u201d, \u201cstatemask_r\u201d, and \u201crice_nomask\u201d). When the method \u201cppo_finetune\u201d is chosen, the code calls `train_ppo_finetune` from baselines.py. Since there is no additional logic to load or insert the optimized explanation (MaskNetworkPolicy), this method does not incorporate the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation.\n\u2022 Although the paper requires that for the selfish mining environment the PPO fine-tuning refinement uses the optimized explanation method, there is no conditional logic or tailoring for selfish mining versus other environments in the PPO fine-tuning function.\nThus, the expected behavior\u2014to have the PPO fine-tuning refinement method use the optimized (\u201cOurs\u201d) explanation\u2014does not appear in the code. Instead, PPO fine-tuning is implemented in a standard manner without any reference to or usage of MaskNetworkPolicy.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0\n\nThe code does not meet the criterion because the PPO fine-tuning baseline (used in Experiment II for the selfish mining environment) does not incorporate the optimized StateMask (\u201cOurs\u201d) explanation method.

In the RICECallback (also in rice.py), this method is used (with 1.0 subtracted from the probability to compute importance scores), which conforms with the optimized explanation method described in the paper.\n\u2022 In rice.py, within the function train_rice, the code loads the mask network via \u201cPPO.load(mask_network_path, device=device_load, custom_objects={'policy_class': MaskNetworkPolicy})\u201d. This step ensures that the optimized MaskNetworkPolicy (i.e., \u201cOurs\u201d) is used as the explanation method in the refinement process.\n\u2022 Additionally, RICECallback in rice.py also uses the mask_policy\u2019s predict_mask_prob method during the _update_critical_states() function to compute state importance and select the critical state for resets.\nAlthough the code is generic across environments (and does not explicitly hard-code \"network defence\"), its modular design implies that when the network defence environment is used, the same codepath will invoke the optimized StateMask (\u201cOurs\u201d) explanation method. There is no alternative fallback or different explanation method for the \"Ours\" refinement branch; the MaskNetworkPolicy implementation in state_mask.py is the one used.\nThis implementation matches the expectation for the optimized explanation method being used with the \"Ours\" refinement method.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1\n\nThe submission demonstrates a correct implementation of the optimized StateMask (\"Ours\") explanation method as required. The MaskNetworkPolicy class (in state_mask.py) and its integration within the RICE training code (in rice.py and RICECallback) clearly indicate that the intended explanation method is used for generating critical states in the refinement process. Although the code is written in a modular way supporting multiple environments, it correctly loads and employs the optimized mask network when running the Refinement (\u201cOurs\u201d) method, which meets the criterion.",

None of the files contains code that accumulates rewards explicitly (for example, by summing rewards over an episode) nor does any part of the code describe logging cumulative reward metrics (such as printing episode total rewards or saving them to a log file) tailored for the network defence environment.

Concretely, in the code that implements StateMask\u2010R (typically a refinement function such as train_statemask_r), the mask network should be loaded using the custom policy class (MaskNetworkPolicy) defined in the paper\u2019s optimized StateMask section. This class should provide the improved predict_mask_prob method and associated logic for \u201cOurs.\u201d In other words, I will look for in the submission that the function for the StateMask\u2010R refinement (for example, the function train_statemask_r in baselines.py) calls the load_policy function with the custom_policy_class argument set to MaskNetworkPolicy (the optimized \u201cOurs\u201d version). This would indicate that the refined procedure for network defence is indeed using the optimized explanation method as required.\n\n# Reality\nUpon reviewing the submission files, I focused on the file src/baselines.py which contains the function train_statemask_r. In this function (starting at about line 50), the code attempts the following:\n\u2022 It loads the target policy via load_policy.\n\u2022 It specifically loads the mask network policy by calling:\n\u2003\u2003mask_policy_obj = load_policy(mask_network_path, 'PPO', custom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy)\nThe MaskNetworkPolicy is imported from src/state_mask.py. In state_mask.py, the MaskNetworkPolicy class is implemented as an optimized version of the StateMask explanation method (which corresponds to \u201cOurs\u201d as described in the paper). There is no indication that an alternative (e.g., a random explanation) is used in this branch. Furthermore, in the file src/run_refinement.py the code dispatches among multiple methods and for the \"statemask_r\" method it calls train_statemask_r. Although the network defence environment is not explicitly singled out by name here, the function is generic and when run on the network defence environment (e.g. CageChallenge2 or similar), it inherently uses the mask network loaded as above. This shows that for the StateMask\u2010R method, the code uses the optimized \u201cOurs\u201d explanation (via MaskNetworkPolicy) as required.\n\n# Score\nI assign a score of 1.

In practice this means that the implementation should include a mask network (for example, a \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d class) that is trained with the optimized (improved efficiency and similar fidelity) design from the paper. In the refined training (RICE) procedure, the code should load this mask network\u2014typically via a custom policy specification\u2014and integrate it (for example, via a callback) so that the explanation method guides the resetting of states in the refinement process. In short, I expect to see a concrete implementation in files such as state_mask.py (for the explanation method) and rice.py (for the refinement method) that loads and uses this mask network (using custom_objects in load_policy calls) and applies it in the training of the refined agent. I will look for code that shows use of the MaskNetworkPolicy and its integration into the RICE callback during the refinement process.\n\n# Reality\nExamining the submission:\n\u2022 In \"src/state_mask.py\", there is a class named \"MaskNetworkPolicy\" that inherits from ActorCriticPolicy and is designed for a binary action space (interpreting \u201ckeep\u201d vs \u201cblind\u201d). Its method \"predict_mask_prob\" computes the probability for the \"blind\" action. This implementation reflects the optimized explanation method (referred to as \"Ours\") since it is meant to replace or improve on the original StateMask.\n\u2022 In \"src/rice.py\", the function \"train_rice\" loads both the target policy and the mask network. It does so using a call that passes custom_objects with {'policy_class': MaskNetworkPolicy} when loading the mask network via PPO.load. It then creates a RICECallback where the mask_policy (an instance of MaskNetworkPolicy) is used along with the target policy. This integration is the key part that implements the optimized explanation method in the RICE (i.e., \"Ours\") refinement procedure.\n\u2022 In \"scripts/run_refinement.py\", when the method selected is \"rice\" (the refinement method corresponding to \"Ours\"), the code assigns the mask network path to current_mask_path so that train_rice receives it correctly.\nAlthough there isn\u2019t an explicit block labeled \u201cautonomous driving\u201d (the code is generic across environments), the design permits the same code to be used for autonomous driving when the appropriate environment ID is passed. Thus, for the autonomous driving environment the \u201cOurs\u201d refinement method (via RICE and the MaskNetworkPolicy) would indeed be used.\n\n# Score\nI award a score of 1. The code clearly implements the optimized StateMask (\"Ours\") explanation method (via MaskNetworkPolicy in state_mask.py) and integrates it into the RICE refinement procedure (in rice.py and related wrappers) so that when the autonomous driving environment is targeted with the \"Ours\" refinement method, the optimized explanation guiding the critical state resets is used.",

The implementation should include explicit code that, during refinement, either adds up the rewards from each rollout/episode or records them using the callback mechanism. For example, I would expect to see a variable that sums up rewards for an episode and then logs this sum after the episode ends. Alternatively, the code might call logger.record with a metric like \u201crollout/episode_reward\u201d or similar.

There is no explicit code that computes or logs a \u201ccumulative reward\u201d (i.e. the sum of all extrinsic rewards over an episode or a refinement period) during refinement. Additionally, while the fidelity.py file does compute a cumulative reward (named original_reward) during a \u201cperturbed trajectory\u201d run for fidelity scoring, that is solely within the fidelity evaluation function and not a part of the continuous refinement process.

In practice, this means that the code should load and utilize a mask network implementation that embodies the improvements described in Section 3.3 (\u201cOurs\u201d explanation method) rather than a random or legacy version. In our code review, I will look for functions or modules (such as a \u201ctrain_statemask_r\u201d function and a MaskNetworkPolicy class) that load or use the optimized mask network via a custom policy class. Specifically, I expect to see that the StateMask-R baseline function loads the mask network using a parameter like custom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy (or similar) so that the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method is employed, even for the autonomous driving environment.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission contains several relevant files:\n- In **src/state_mask.py**, there is a class named `MaskNetworkPolicy` which is derived from `ActorCriticPolicy`. This class implements methods such as `predict_mask_prob` (which returns the probability of taking the blind action) and is seemingly designed to incorporate the optimized approach (for example, it is used alongside a wrapper that modifies rewards via an alpha bonus). This implementation corresponds to the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method described in the paper.\n- In **src/baselines.py**, the function `train_statemask_r` is defined. In it, the mask network policy is loaded with a call to `load_policy` using the parameter `custom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy`. This ensures that the mask network used in the StateMask-R refinement method is indeed the one implemented in **src/state_mask.py** (i.e. the optimized \u201cOurs\u201d version).\n- Although there is no specific branching in the code solely for the autonomous driving environment, the system is designed in a generic modular fashion such that for any provided environment\u2014including autonomous driving\u2014the StateMask-R routine (in baselines.py) will load the optimized mask network through MaskNetworkPolicy.\n- The code in **src/state_mask.py** shows modifications (e.g. in the `MaskEnvWrapper` that adds a reward bonus) that align with the optimized version proposed by the paper.\n\nThus, the submission appears to use the optimized \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method (via MaskNetworkPolicy) when running the StateMask-R refinement method, which satisfies the requirement for the autonomous driving experiment as outlined.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submitted code correctly loads and uses the optimized (Ours) version of the mask network within the StateMask-R refinement function (via custom_policy_class=MaskNetworkPolicy). Although no environment-specific override is seen for autonomous driving, the generic implementation ensures that if the autonomous driving environment is used as input, the optimized explanation method will be applied as required.",

The submission fails to implement the requirement for the \"JSRL\" refinement method in Experiment II for the autonomous driving environment because it clearly skips the JSRL branch (due to external dependencies) and does not include any code to measure cumulative reward throughout refinement.",

In particular, the paper requires that the cumulative reward be measured \u201cthroughout refinement\u201d so that the performance of the refined agent can be compared when using, for example, a Random explanation baseline. Concretely, I expect to see code that (a) runs episodes in a MuJoCo environment, (b) collects and sums rewards to produce a cumulative reward value for each episode, and (c) uses the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method (typically by generating random importance scores) to influence some aspect of the experiment while still measuring the overall cumulative rewards. In our context, this would appear in a function that calculates a fidelity score or evaluates the refined policy performance when explanation_policy is set to None (indicating the \u201cRandom\u201d method). I will look for sections of code that (1) determine cumulative (episode or trajectory) reward; (2) use a random explanation method (e.g. by calling a function like get_random_importance_scores); and (3) use these cumulative reward values to compare the original versus perturbed trajectories during the refinement evaluation.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, I have examined the file \u201csrc/fidelity.py.\u201d In the function \u201ccalculate_fidelity_score,\u201d the code first resets the environment, then runs the agent\u2019s policy over a trajectory while accumulating the rewards in the variable \u201coriginal_reward\u201d. This loop gathers the cumulative reward (summing \u201creward\u201d from each step) from the original (unperturbed) run. Then, if the explanation_policy parameter is not provided (i.e. is None), the function \u201cget_random_importance_scores\u201d is called to obtain random importance scores for the entire trajectory. This exactly implements the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method. Next, the function \u201crun_perturbed_trajectory\u201d also computes \u201ctotal_reward_perturbed\u201d by summing the rewards over the randomly controlled segment and subsequent steps. Thus, both the original and perturbed cumulative rewards are measured. \n\nThis design shows that the implementation measures cumulative reward for each trajectory and does so for the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method (since the code path with explanation_policy == None uses \u201cget_random_importance_scores\u201d). In other parts of the code (for instance, in the environment wrappers), there is handling of reward signals, but the main expected measurement is demonstrated in \u201ccalculate_fidelity_score\u201d which is used for evaluating the fidelity (and hence indirectly the cumulative reward performance) of the explanation method during refinement. This meets my expectations.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1. The submission clearly contains code that measures cumulative reward over trajectories using the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method (via the get_random_importance_scores branch in calculate_fidelity_score in src/fidelity.py), which satisfies the criterion.",

This could take the form of code that, on each training rollout or episode during refinement, accumulates the rewards (e.g. via a running sum) and then logs or outputs these cumulative rewards (for example, printing them or sending them to TensorBoard) so that one can see the learning curve. In practice, one would see such code either embedded in the refinement training loop or as an evaluation function that runs the refined model for several episodes\u2014specifically for the \u201cStateMask\u201d explanation method\u2014and reports the cumulative reward.

However, that code is used to compute a fidelity score by comparing the \u201coriginal_reward\u201d (obtained from executing a \u201cnormal\u201d trajectory) to a \u201cperturbed_reward\u201d (obtained after randomizing the actions in a critical segment). While it does sum rewards over a trajectory, this function is for fidelity evaluation (Experiment I) and not for tracking cumulative reward during the actual refinement training process.\n- In \u201csrc/baselines.py\u201d the function \u201ctrain_statemask_r\u201d sets up a refinement procedure intended for using the StateMask explanation method (by resetting solely to critical states). However, the calls to the actual training (e.g. \u201cmodel.learn(\u2026)\u201d) are commented out. There is no additional code in this function that explicitly accumulates or logs the cumulative reward over episodes during the refinement phase.\n- In \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d the refinement function \u201ctrain_rice\u201d likewise sets up a PPO training loop for refinement. Though it prints status messages, the core training call is commented out and there is no explicit code shown that accumulates and logs the cumulative reward as training progresses.\n- In \u201csrc/state_mask.py\u201d the implementation of MaskNetworkPolicy and related wrapping (such as MaskEnvWrapper) pertain to the explanation method itself. They modify rewards (e.g. by adding an extra term using \u201calpha * mask_action\u201d) but do not themselves log or accumulate the total reward over the course of an episode.\n\nOverall, while there is code that computes a cumulative reward within the fidelity score function, there is no indication of any dedicated code that records or outputs the cumulative reward throughout the refinement training phase for the StateMask explanation method in the MuJoCo environments.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 0 because although the submission includes code for fidelity evaluation (which involves summing rewards over a trajectory), it does not contain a correct implementation for measuring and tracking cumulative reward throughout the refinement phase when using the StateMask explanation method.

Specifically, I would expect that during the refinement phase (Experiment III), the code logs or accumulates the total reward obtained over an entire trajectory (or across refinement iterations) so that the refinement performance can be compared. Such an implementation might consist of a loop that, for each rollout in the selfish mining environment, sums the reward (often stored in a variable like \u201coriginal_reward\u201d) and then records that value (for example, printing it out, logging it, or saving it to a file) so that the cumulative reward during refinement is clearly measured. I would look for functions where:\n\u2013 A trajectory is generated from the environment,\n\u2013 Rewards are accumulated over the episode (e.g. \u201coriginal_reward += reward\u201d),\n\u2013 The specific \u201cRandom\u201d method is used (e.g. detecting that no explanation policy is provided or that a random importance score is being applied),\n\u2013 And this cumulative reward is then reported or logged throughout refinement.\n\n# Reality\nLooking through the submitted files:\n\u2022 In src/fidelity.py we see a function called calculate_fidelity_score. In that function, a trajectory is generated by resetting the environment and obtaining actions from the target policy. In the while\u2011loop that generates the trajectory, we see code that accumulates the reward in a variable \u201coriginal_reward\u201d (i.e. \u201coriginal_reward += reward\u201d). This does measure cumulative reward for the unperturbed trajectory, and if no explanation policy is provided then get_random_importance_scores is used.\n\u2022 However, this implementation is aimed at evaluating the fidelity of the explanation (Experiment I) rather than directly measuring the cumulative reward output \u201cthroughout refinement\u201d for the selfish mining environment.\n\u2022 Looking at the refinement\u2010related code in files such as src/rice.py and src/baselines.py, the submitted code sets up the refinements (for example, functions like train_rice, train_ppo_finetune, and train_statemask_r). These functions call PPO\u2019s learn() methods, and while PPO internally logs episodic reward statistics, there is no explicit code to differentiate or record the cumulative reward \u201cthroughout refinement\u201d for one specific explanation method (namely the \u201cRandom\u201d one) in the context of the selfish mining environment.\n\u2022 Furthermore, there is no code specific to the selfish mining environment (i.e. using an environment ID or custom logic for selfish mining) that conditionally selects and logs the cumulative reward when the Random explanation method is used.\n  \nThus, although the fidelity score code in fidelity.py accumulates reward, it is not directly \u201ccumulative reward measurement throughout refinement\u201d for the selfish mining environment under the Random explanation method. There is no dedicated logging, plotting, or accumulation function that clearly measures and reports the cumulative reward during refinement when the random explanation baseline is chosen.\n\n# Score\nI award a score of 0. The submission does not contain a clear, dedicated implementation that measures cumulative reward throughout the refinement process specifically for the selfish mining environment using the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method. While there is code for accumulating reward in the fidelity evaluation function, this does not address the criterion of tracking cumulative reward during the refinement phase as required.",

In practice, this could be implemented by accumulating the reward obtained in each episode (or over multiple episodes) during the refinement training and then logging or saving that value (for example, by printing it, writing it to a file, or sending it to the logger used by the RL algorithm). In addition, since the criterion is specific to the network defence environment, there might be code (even if parameterized by the environment id) that shows \u201cif env == network_defence\u201d then the cumulative reward is measured. I would look for code that, during refinement training (or evaluation) of the refined agent, sums up the rewards over an episode and reports this cumulative reward over time for methods that use a random explanation. This might be done in evaluation scripts (e.g. in a fidelity or evaluation routine) or by using callbacks/logging within training functions.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, the files include several key modules such as \"src/fidelity.py\", \"src/rice.py\", \"src/baselines.py\", and so on. The \"src/fidelity.py\" file defines a function called calculate_fidelity_score that runs a trajectory, accumulating an \u201coriginal_reward\u201d (by incrementing a variable with reward values in the episode loop) and then uses that along with the perturbed reward to compute a fidelity score. Although this computation does sum rewards (thus obtaining the cumulative reward for that episode), it is primarily used for fidelity evaluation rather than tracking cumulative reward \u201cthroughout refinement.\u201d\n\nThe refinement (training) routines such as those in \"src/rice.py\" (for the RICE method) and the baseline functions in \"src/baselines.py\" do not include any explicit code that measures or logs the cumulative reward during the refinement process. There is no environment\u2010 or method\u2010specific branch that is clearly written for a network defence environment, nor does any block of code explicitly aggregate and output cumulative reward values over time in the refinement training loop for the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method. The \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method is implemented in fidelity.py by the function get_random_importance_scores (which returns random numbers), but that is used only when evaluating fidelity (and hence cumulative reward is computed per trajectory in that function). No other locations in the code are found (for example in the training callbacks or the baseline training functions) that would measure cumulative reward (as a running total or as a logged metric) during the refinement process.\n\nAdditionally, nothing in the submitted code specifically targets the network defence environment (for example, by checking the environment id) to perform this reward logging. The mechanisms for evaluation are generic and parameterized by the environment id but do not present extra cumulative reward measurement features for network defence.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0. \n\nThe submission does not contain any explicit implementation that measures and logs the cumulative reward throughout the refinement process specifically for the network defence environment using the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method.

However, this summing is used for fidelity evaluation and not for measuring cumulative reward during the refinement process.\n- In **baselines.py**, functions such as `train_ppo_finetune` and `train_statemask_r` are provided to set up baseline refinement methods, but their training loops are mostly commented out or use the default SB3 learning routines. There is no explicit code here that adds custom logging or tracking of the cumulative reward beyond what SB3 might inherently log.\n- In **rice.py**, which contains the main implementation for the RICE refinement procedure, the callback (`RICECallback`) logs values such as \u201crollout/intrinsic_reward_mean\u201d and \u201crollout/critical_reset_rate.\u201d However, there is no explicit implementation that sums and reports cumulative reward (i.e. the total episode reward) throughout refinement\u2014even though SB3\u2019s PPO might automatically track episode reward, there is no custom code here that measures or outputs it in the context of the network defence environment specifically.\n- Additionally, none of the files show any environment\u2010specific branches or logging instructions (e.g. for CageChallenge2, assumed to be the network defence environment) that would indicate cumulative reward measurement for that particular environment and for the StateMask explanation method.\n\nOverall, while there is code calculating some reward sums in the fidelity score evaluation (which is tangential to this criterion), there is nothing clearly coded to measure and report the cumulative reward during refinement in the network defence environment using StateMask.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 0.

I expect to see these steps clearly implemented in the code, for example in the RICE refinement component or critical state update routines, preferably in files related to state_mask or rice.\n\n# Reality  \nLooking in the submission there are several files that implement key components:  \n- In **src/state_mask.py**, the class \u201cMaskNetworkPolicy\u201d is implemented. It defines a method \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d which computes probabilities over two discrete actions (with the intended interpretation that probabilities are used for blinding versus keeping the original action). This is the core part of the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.  \n- In **src/fidelity.py**, the helper function \u201cget_importance_scores\u201d calls the mask policy\u2019s \u201cpredict_mask_prob\u201d function and then computes importance scores as 1.0 minus these probabilities. This shows that the importance of each step is derived using the \u201cOurs\u201d method.  \n- Most importantly, in **src/rice.py** within the _update_critical_states method (inside the RICECallback class), the code collects a trajectory and uses the mask policy to compute importance scores with the line:  \n  \u201cimportance_scores = 1.0 - mask_probs_1\u201d  \n  and then selects the critical step by \u201ccritical_step_index = np.argmax(importance_scores)\u201d. If the environment supports state saving (e.g., MuJoCo), it then saves the corresponding state (qpos, qvel) as the critical state.  \nAlthough the code is written in a generic way (i.e. it is environment-agnostic), if the network defence environment was set up accordingly then this exact mechanism would be used there as well. The integration of the mask network into the RICE framework indicates that the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method is indeed utilized to identify the critical step.\n\n# Score  \nI give a score of 1.  \nThe submission clearly contains code that implements the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method (using the MaskNetworkPolicy and its predict_mask_prob method) and integrates it to determine the critical state via an argmax operation, as evidenced in src/rice.py. This meets the criterion that for the network defence environment (when set up), the \u201cOurs\u201d method is used to select the critical step for refinement.",

In particular, I expect to see a custom policy class (e.g. MaskNetworkPolicy) that outputs, for each input state, a probability (or score) indicating the \u201cmask\u201d decision. The critical step should then be identified by using these scores (typically by taking the complement, e.g., 1 \u2013 probability). Concretely, the code should:\n\u2022 Implement a function (or method) like predict_mask_prob in the MaskNetworkPolicy class that produces the probability for taking the \u201cblind\u201d action.\n\u2022 Use this output to compute an importance score (e.g., importance = 1 \u2013 mask probability).\n\u2022 Then select the critical step (or segment) from a trajectory by, for instance, taking the argmax of these importance scores or via a sliding window approach.\nI will look in the submission for these functions in files such as state_mask.py (for the MaskNetworkPolicy definition), and verify that the critical step is computed (for instance, in the RICECallback\u2019s _update_critical_states method) so that if the autonomous driving environment were used, its critical state would be selected via the \u201cStateMask\u201d explanation method.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission includes several relevant files:\n\u2022 In \"src/state_mask.py\", there is a class named MaskNetworkPolicy which inherits from ActorCriticPolicy. It implements a method called predict_mask_prob that computes the probability of taking the masking action (action 1). This method returns the probability (obtained from the action distribution) corresponding to masking. This is consistent with the \u201cStateMask\u201d explanation method.\n\u2022 In \"src/fidelity.py\", the function get_importance_scores calls predict_mask_prob on a given policy and computes importance scores by taking 1 \u2013 the mask probability. It then is used in find_critical_segment to locate the segment with the highest average importance. This shows that the explanation (StateMask) is used to assess which steps are critical.\n\u2022 In \"src/rice.py\", inside the RICECallback class there is the method _update_critical_states. This method creates a trajectory (using an evaluation environment), computes mask probabilities via self.mask_policy.predict_mask_prob, converts them into importance scores (1 \u2013 mask probability), and then selects the critical state by taking np.argmax on these scores. While the code is generic across environments, it clearly supports all environments (including autonomous driving) and uses the StateMask explanation method to identify the critical step for refinement.\nAlthough no file is dedicated solely to autonomous driving, the code is written in a generic way and the default parameters (e.g., in run_fidelity.py and run_refinement.py) include support for an \"AutoDriving\" environment. Therefore, if the autonomous driving environment is set up, the same logic with the StateMask explanation method will be used.\n\n# Score\nI award a score of 1 because the implementation correctly includes the MaskNetworkPolicy class with the required predict_mask_prob method and integrates it within the critical state selection process (e.g., the _update_critical_states method in RICECallback). This satisfies the criterion that for the autonomous driving environment the StateMask explanation method is utilized to identify the critical step.",

In practice, this might be done by summing the rewards received over each episode during the refinement phase and logging or printing these values periodically (for example via a callback or an evaluation routine). This would let one see a learning curve\u2014showing the cumulative reward per episode or per fixed interval of refinement timesteps specifically for the autonomous driving task when using StateMask. In other words, I would expect code that (a) runs evaluation episodes during the refinement training loop, (b) sums up the rewards to get the cumulative reward per episode, and (c) records or outputs this value.\n\n# Reality\nIn the files provided, the code generally covers several aspects of the reproduction, including fidelity score calculation and various training setups. However, in reviewing the relevant files (particularly \"src/fidelity.py\", \"src/rice.py\", and \"scripts/run_refinement.py\"), I did not identify any explicit implementation that measures the cumulative reward during the refinement process for the autonomous driving environment when using the StateMask explanation method.\n\nFor example, in \"src/fidelity.py\" there is code that runs a trajectory and computes an \u201coriginal_reward\u201d (by summing rewards over a trajectory) as part of the fidelity score calculation. However, this routine is used for fidelity evaluation (Experiment I) rather than for tracking cumulative reward during the iterative refinement process.\n\nSimilarly, in \"src/rice.py\" the main refinement function (train_rice) is provided and a callback (RICECallback) is defined, but the callback logs the mean intrinsic reward and the rate of successful critical-state resets\u2014not the cumulative (per-episode) reward. In addition, the train_rice function itself calls PPO\u2019s learn method (which itself may log rewards via the Stable Baselines3 logger), but there is no custom or explicit code added to measure and output the cumulative reward specifically as a part of the StateMask refinement process in the autonomous driving context.\n\nThere is also no specific treatment in the code that distinguishes the autonomous driving environment or that indicates measurement of cumulative reward \u201cthroughout refinement\u201d in that particular case. The code for tracking cumulative reward during the refinement appears to be missing or is only implicitly handled by the underlying PPO framework rather than via any reproduction-specific code.\n\n# Score\n0 \u2013 The submission does not include a clear, dedicated implementation for measuring cumulative reward during the refinement phase for the autonomous driving environment using the StateMask explanation method. Although some sections (e.g., the fidelity score calculation) do sum rewards over a trajectory, there is no explicit code (such as logging or evaluation callbacks) that tracks and reports the cumulative rewards during the refinement training as required by the criterion.",

We might look for a variable such as \u201cepisode_reward\u201d, \u201ccumulative_reward\u201d, or similar being updated per episode and then output (or recorded via a logger or tensorboard) throughout refinement.\n\n# Reality\nAfter reviewing the submitted files, in particular the key files \"rice.py\", \"baselines.py\", \"state_mask.py\", and the various scripts (e.g., \"run_refinement.py\"), we note the following:\n- The file \"rice.py\" implements the RICE training function (`train_rice`) along with a callback class (`RICECallback`) that is intended to handle refinement by updating critical states and training RND predictor networks. Within `RICECallback`, we see logging for metrics such as \"rollout/intrinsic_reward_mean\" and \"rollout/critical_reset_rate\", but there is no explicit reference to tracking or logging the cumulative reward (i.e. the full episode reward) throughout the refinement process.\n- In \"baselines.py\", the fine-tuning and StateMask-R training setups are present, but again, there is no specific implementation of code that measures cumulative reward during the refinement process.\n- None of the scripts (e.g., \"run_refinement.py\") include additional code to compute or log cumulative reward trajectories that would confirm the evolution of performance over time in the autonomous driving context.\n- Moreover, there is no special code branch that is triggered when the environment is autonomous driving (or any handling specific to that environment) to measure cumulative reward for the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method. The measurement of rewards appears to be handled generically by the underlying PPO training (if it were executed), but no custom mechanism is provided for explicitly accumulating and logging cumulative reward during refinement.\n\nThus, while the submission contains the core components of the RICE framework and related training functions, it does not include an explicit, dedicated implementation for measuring and tracking the cumulative reward throughout refinement specifically for the autonomous driving environment under the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0\n\nThe submission does not meet the criterion because there is no dedicated implementation in the provided code that explicitly measures or logs the cumulative reward throughout refinement for the autonomous driving environment using the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.",

This means that during training loops (whether pretraining a baseline agent with PPO/SAC or during the refinement process with RICE or related methods) the code should:\n\u2022 Accumulate reward values received from the environment (for example, summing rewards across an episode).\n\u2022 Possibly store these reward values in an \u201cinfo\u201d field or print/log them (e.g. via callbacks or direct accumulation in a loop) so that performance over time can be monitored.\n\u2022 In addition, if intrinsic rewards (e.g., from the RND component) are combined with extrinsic rewards during refinement, the code should clearly apply this combination and may record the original (extrinsic) reward separately.\nI would therefore look for functions that add up rewards (e.g., \u201coriginal_reward += reward\u201d in a step loop) and code that modifies or logs the reward (for example, using wrappers or callbacks that record \u201coriginal_reward\u201d in the info dictionary).\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission I found several relevant code snippets:\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/fidelity.py\u201d, the function \u201ccalculate_fidelity_score\u201d runs episodes using the target policy. Within its main loop, it accumulates the reward in a variable called \u201coriginal_reward\u201d (e.g., \u201coriginal_reward += reward\u201d) as it steps through the environment. It also computes a \u201cperturbed_reward\u201d in a helper function \u201crun_perturbed_trajectory\u201d by similarly accumulating rewards. This shows that the code explicitly measures the reward signal over a complete trajectory for fidelity evaluation.\n\u2022 In \u201csrc/rice.py\u201d, within the class \u201cRNDRewardWrapper\u201d (which is used during refinement), the \u201cstep_wait\u201d function retrieves the reward from a call to \u201cenv.step_wait()\u201d and then computes \u201ccombined_rewards\u201d by adding a scaled normalized intrinsic reward. Importantly, the code also stores the original reward in each info dictionary via the line \u201cinfos[i]['original_reward'] = rewards[i]\u201d. This indicates that even when rewards are being augmented by intrinsic components, the original reward is recorded.\n\u2022 In the training scripts (e.g., \u201cscripts/train_pretrained.py\u201d and \u201cscripts/run_refinement.py\u201d), while much of the training is delegated to stable-baselines3\u2019s \u201clearn\u201d methods (which internally log rewards), the custom code has provided wrappers and logging (through the RICECallback and RNDRewardWrapper) that ensure reward information is captured during refinement.\nThese pieces match the expectation that reward measurement is implemented explicitly\u2014both via accumulating rewards in trajectory loops (for fidelity experiments) and by recording original rewards in wrapper classes that handle reward augmentation.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1. The submission does implement reward measurement code throughout pretraining and refinement. The \u201ccalculate_fidelity_score\u201d function in fidelity.py explicitly accumulates the reward per episode, and the \u201cRNDRewardWrapper\u201d in rice.py clearly logs and passes along the original reward before combining it with intrinsic reward. These implementations satisfy the criterion.",
