There is no special handling required for this environment, and the approach is consistent with the paper\u2019s reliance on a generic RL agent architecture.\n\n# Score\n1 \u2013 The submission meets the criterion. The code correctly sets up a gym environment using the standard gym.make call wrapped in DummyVecEnv. Although \"HalfCheetah-v3\" is not explicitly mentioned in the benchmark lists, the generic environment initialization mechanism allows the user to use any valid MuJoCo environment (including HalfCheetah) as intended.",

I would look for:\n- A function, class, or parameter flag that chooses between the original StateMask and possibly the new proposed method.\n- Code that explicitly refers to the original StateMask method (for example, by loading pre-trained weights or by calling a function/module dedicated to the original approach).\n- The absence of any training routines for the mask network when using this mode, ensuring that rollouts are generated \u201cwithout training.\u201d\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission:\n- All of the files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py) contain a method called \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d. In these methods, the code calculates \u201ceffectiveness_ratios\u201d by comparing ride rewards in trajectories, then selects states above the 75th percentile as critical.\n- There is no conditional branch or parameter that allows one to select the original StateMask explanation method as described in the paper. Instead, the code always uses a simple heuristic based on reward statistics.\n- There is no indication that a pre-trained mask network (or any model corresponding to the original StateMask that outputs \u201c0\u201d for critical and \u201c1\u201d otherwise) is being loaded or used.\n- The rollouts are generated using this heuristic method and not via a pre-trained, non-training version of StateMask.\n\nThus, the provided code does not demonstrate that the original StateMask Explanation method (as intended for the MuJoCo environments) can be selected for generating rollouts without further training.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0. \n\nThe submission does not include a mechanism to select or use the original StateMask Explanation method for generating rollouts (without training), as required by the criterion. Instead, it only implements a heuristic-based explanation routine and lacks any branch or reference to the original StateMask implementation.",

This would typically be implemented by recording the starting time (using, for example, time.time()) before training begins and the ending time after training (or at key intervals), then computing and logging the elapsed time. Such measurements should be reported in a manner similar to Appendix C.3 and Table 4 in the paper, which compare training times. Additionally, since the criterion concerns the \"StateMask\" explanation method for selfish mining, the code should ideally be executed for that environment (or at least have appropriate conditions/parameters) and include dedicated logging or saving of these timing measurements.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission files (e.g., rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), the authors have implemented various aspects of the RICE method. The files show implementations for training the agent, refining the policy using critical states, and logging various status messages (such as learning rate updates) via logging calls. However, after reviewing the code, there is no sign of any explicit timing measurement code. There are no calls to functions like time.time() or similar timers to record the start and end times of training phases. Instead, the callback (DynamicLRCallback) merely logs learning rate updates and the logs themselves are named with a timestamp in the filename\u2014but that is not the same as measuring and logging the training time throughout training. Also, while many of the files loop over different environments, none are specifically tailored to the selfish mining environment nor do they show alternate behavior for the \"StateMask\" method.

This would be done by, for instance, using time measurements (e.g., using Python\u2019s time.time() to mark the start and end of training segments) and then logging or storing the elapsed time throughout training. Additionally, the code should be specific to the network defence environment and the \u201cStateMask\u201d method, outputting efficiency metrics similar to those reported in Table 4.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, several files are provided (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, rice_visualization.py). Across these files:\n- The code is organized to train a PPO agent with an explanation method via a function called \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d and then refines the policy using a set of critical states.\n- The provided code uses logging (with timestamps in the log filenames via datetime) and contains a \u201cDynamicLRCallback\u201d that adjusts the learning rate.\n- However, in none of these files is there any explicit use of time measurement functions (such as time.time(), time.perf_counter(), or similar) that record the duration of specific training segments. There is no code that measures or logs the overall training time or the training time of the mask network, which is what Table 4 in the paper requires.\n- Moreover, the environments listed in the benchmarking functions (e.g., in rice_method.py, the extended_environment_targets are ['Humanoid-v2', 'Ant-v2', 'Walker2d-v2', 'CarRacing-v0']) don\u2019t include the network defence environment. There is no branch of the code that specifically distinguishes the network defence environment or that uses the \u201cStateMask\u201d explanation method in a way that separately measures its training efficiency.\n- Essentially, while the submission does implement an explanation method for critical state extraction and policy refinement, it does not include any instrumentation to measure training time throughout training (i.e., no timing before/after training segments, no calculation of elapsed time, and no logging of such metrics).\n\n# Score\n0 \u2013 The submission does not meet the criterion because it lacks any implementation code to measure or log the training time throughout training as required for the network defence environment using the \u201cStateMask\u201d explanation method.

Specifically, Appendix C.3 and Table 4 detail that the reproduction should capture the cost (i.e., elapsed time and number of samples) when training the state mask network (or explanation method) and report this timing information. I would therefore be looking for code that uses time tracking (for example, using time.time() or datetime stamps) at the beginning and end of the training routine, and then logs or outputs the total training time. Additionally, the criterion is specific to the network defence environment using the \"Ours\" explanation method, so the implementation should at least allow such measurement during training in that setup.\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the files provided (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, rice_visualization.py), I do not find any explicit implementation for measuring training time. While all files use logging and even include the datetime module to uniquely name log files, none of the files capture or log elapsed time for the training process. For instance, the training routines (in the train() methods) call self.model.learn() with specific timesteps and a dynamic learning rate callback, but there is no code that wraps these calls with timestamps (e.g., using time.time() before and after learning) or calculates the duration of training. In addition, there is no differentiation of environments or additional code paths for a network defence environment specifically, nor any code that outputs training time metrics as expected. Therefore, the submission does not include any measurement of training time as required by the criterion.\n\n# Score\n0 \u2014 The submission does not implement any code to measure and log training time throughout training (as expected for Appendix C.3 and Table 4), so the criterion is not met.",

For example, in rice_method.py:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The method \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d extracts critical states based on a reward threshold.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In the \u201crefine_policy\u201d method, the code does:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003new_initial_states = list(critical_states)[:10]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Then for each state in \u201cnew_initial_states\u201d the environment is reset (obs = self.env.reset()) and then the state is directly set:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003self.env.envs[0].env.state = state  \nThere is no logic that also samples from the default initial state distribution or combines it with the identified critical states. No hyperparameter (e.g., p or \u03b2) controlling such a mixture is visible in any file. The same pattern is repeated in the other files. Thus, the code implements a refining procedure that always uses the identified critical states rather than a mixed distribution.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0  \nThe submission does not meet the criterion. While it correctly identifies critical states via the explanation method, it fails to implement a mixed initial state distribution that combines default initial states with these critical states as described in Section 3.3 of the paper.",

In section 4.1 the paper defines PPO fine-tuning as a refinement method where, after pre-training, the agent is simply further trained with the PPO algorithm using a lowered learning rate while keeping the environment\u2019s initial state unchanged (i.e. continuing training from the default initial state). Technically, I expect to see code that (a) employs PPO (e.g., via Stable Baselines3), (b) lowers the learning rate\u2014typically via some dynamic or decaying learning rate callback\u2014and (c) continues training without modifying the initial state (no resets to critical states). Ideally, this should be implemented as a distinct baseline method in the training pipeline.\n\n# Reality\nLooking across the files (e.g., in rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), I observe that each file defines a DynamicLRCallback class that, during training, reduces the current learning rate by multiplying it by 0.95 every 1000 timesteps. This callback is attached to all calls to self.model.learn(), which means that\u2014that part of lowering the learning rate\u2014is implemented. However, in every file the overall training \u201ctrain\u201d method first calls self.model.learn() to train for a given number of timesteps and then always proceeds to collect trajectories, identify critical states, and then calls a method (refine_policy) that resets the environment\u2019s state to one of these critical states before further learning occurs. In effect, the pipeline always uses explanation-based state resets as part of the refinement phase; there is no branch or separate implementation that simply continues training on the default initial state (without such resets) after lowering the learning rate. Therefore, while the dynamic learning rate component is present, the submission does not separately implement pure \u201cPPO fine-tuning\u201d as a baseline refinement method where the only change would be a lowered LR with continued training on the default initial state.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0  \nExplanation: Although the submission implements a dynamic learning rate callback which is part of lowering the learning rate during PPO training, it does not separate or provide an implementation of the baseline PPO fine-tuning refinement method exactly as described in section 4.1. Instead, every refinement run uses a procedure that resets the environment to critical states (via explanation-based extraction), which does not match the expected approach of simply continuing training on the default initial state with a decaying learning rate.",

This indeed embodies the mechanism of \u201cresetting to the identified critical states and continuing training.\u201d\nHowever, these implementations are entirely generic: they are applied to environment names drawn from standard RL benchmarks such as \u201cHumanoid-v2\u201d, \u201cAnt-v2\u201d, \u201cWalker2d-v2\u201d, and \u201cCarRacing-v0\u201d.

Typically, this is implemented by sampling from a mixture\u2014with a hyperparameter (often denoted as p or \u03b2) controlling the probability of choosing from the critical-state set versus the default distribution. In code, I would expect to see logic that sometimes resets the environment to a default state (using env.reset() normally) and other times forces the environment into a state taken from the set of critical states obtained via the explanation method. There should be an explicit mixture of these two sources rather than exclusively using one.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission files (especially in rice_method.py, and similarly in the other files like rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), the \u201crefine_policy\u201d function obtains a set of critical states via the explain_and_identify_critical_states() function. In refine_policy, the code takes a subset (the first 10) of these critical states and then, for each state, it calls:\n\u2003\u2003obs = self.env.reset()\n\u2003\u2003self.env.envs[0].env.state = state\nfollowed immediately by self.model.learn(...). This shows that the implementation resets the environment explicitly to one of the identified critical states for refinement. There is no evidence of any mechanism (for example, a probabilistic decision or a mixing parameter) that combines these critical states with the default initial states. Instead, the code exclusively uses the critical states\u2014not a mixture\u2014to initialize training episodes.\n\nMoreover, the code is generic across environments (using names like 'Humanoid-v2', etc.) and does not include environment-specific handling nor does it include any branch that uses the default initial state distribution in tandem with the critical states. Thus, for the selfish mining environment (which should be handled similarly and would require the same mixing), the code lacks the intended mixed initialization.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0. The submission fails the criterion because it does not implement a mixed initial state distribution that combines default initial states with the critical states identified by the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.

This means that when refining the pre-trained policy on the network defence environment, the code should randomly select the starting state for each learning episode from a combination of the default initial state (obtained by calling something like env.reset()) and a set of critical states identified by the explanation method. In practice, the implementation should include a sampling procedure or a probability\u2013based condition (with a hyperparameter such as p) that sometimes uses the default initial state and other times uses one of the critical states, rather than relying exclusively on one or the other. This mixture is key to avoid overfitting solely on critical states while still leveraging the identified states for policy enhancement.\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the submission files (such as in \"rice_method.py\", \"rice_performance_analysis.py\", \"rice_enhanced_assessment.py\", and \"rice_visualization.py\"), I observe that each of them contains methods named \"explain_and_identify_critical_states\" which extract critical states from collected trajectories. However, in the corresponding \"refine_policy\" functions, the code simply takes a subset of these critical states (e.g., by doing new_initial_states = list(critical_states)[:10]) and then resets the environment by directly overwriting the state with a critical state:\n\u2003\u2003obs = self.env.reset()\n\u2003\u2003self.env.envs[0].env.state = state\nThere is no logic that combines these critical states with the default initial state distribution. There is also no conditional or probabilistic mixing (e.g., sampling from default states with some probability and from critical states with complementary probability). Moreover, none of the code appears to target a network defence environment specifically (the environments used are typical Gym benchmarks like Humanoid-v2, Ant-v2, etc.). Overall, the implementation does not reflect the intended construction of a mixed initial state distribution as required by the paper.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0  \nThe submission does not implement the mixed initial state distribution for the network defence environment. Instead, it only resets to critical states and does not blend these with default initial states.

In the paper (section 4.1), the \u201cPPO fine-tuning\u201d method is described as a baseline refinement approach that continues policy training while reducing the learning rate, typically to help the agent overcome bottlenecks. I would look for code that sets up a PPO agent and, after some initial training, continues fine-tuning by reducing the learning rate (for example, via a decay schedule or callback) and then calling the PPO learn routine to continue training. Specifically, I expect to find a callback or method that adjusts the learning rate (e.g. multiplies it by a factor like 0.95 periodically) and then subsequent calls to the model\u2019s learn() method with parameters such as reset_num_timesteps=False to continue training without starting over.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submitted files (specifically in rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), there is a class called DynamicLRCallback defined in each file. This callback\u2019s _on_step method checks every 1000 timesteps and adjusts the learning rate by multiplying the current learning rate by 0.95, then updates the model\u2019s learning_rate accordingly.

For example, in rice_method.py the method is defined as follows:\n\n\u2022 It converts the set of critical states to a list (taking the first ten).\n\u2022 For each of these states, it resets the environment with \u201cobs = self.env.reset()\u201d and then directly sets the environment\u2019s internal state via \u201cself.env.envs[0].env.state = state\u201d.\n\u2022 It then continues training the model on that state by calling \u201cself.model.learn(total_timesteps=2000, reset_num_timesteps=False, callback=self.callback)\u201d.\n\nThis approach precisely matches the expected StateMask fine-tuning mechanism: resetting to identified critical states and resuming training from there. Furthermore, the benchmark environments array in the code includes environments such as 'CarRacing-v0', which is appropriate for an autonomous driving type scenario.\n\n# Score\n1 \u2013 The submission includes a clear and correct implementation of the StateMask fine-tuning method (StateMask-R) for fine-tuning in the autonomous driving environment. The code resets the environment to critical states and continues training from those states as required, meeting the criterion.",

This is logged accordingly. This callback is a clear implementation of lowering the learning rate dynamically.\n- **Fine-Tuning via Continued Training**: In the method `refine_policy`, the code resets the environment to a \u201ccritical state\u201d (or applies some fine-tuning conditions) and then calls `self.model.learn(total_timesteps=2000, reset_num_timesteps=False, callback=self.callback)`. In addition, the overall `train` method first calls a primary learning phase (`.learn(total_timesteps=total_timesteps // 2, callback=self.callback)`) and then the refinement phase (after trajectory collection and state analysis, it calls the refinement which again learns further with PPO). This amounts to continuing training with modified (lowered) learning rate.\n- **Environment Details**: Although the code is written generically, one of the environments in the comprehensive evaluations is \u201cCarRacing-v0\u201d (seen in extended_environment_targets and environment evaluation lists). CarRacing-v0 serves as an autonomous driving task within gym, which meets the requirement of the autonomous driving environment.\n\nThus, the submission clearly implements a PPO fine-tuning refinement method by lowering the learning rate via the callback while continuing training with PPO.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1\n\nThe submission meets the criterion because it includes a DynamicLRCallback that systematically lowers the learning rate during continued PPO training, and this mechanism is applied within the refinement phase for environments including an autonomous driving equivalent (CarRacing-v0).",

In practice, I would expect to see a function (or multiple functions) that, at regular intervals or after each refinement update, sums up the rewards received from an episode (or across several episodes) to provide a performance metric. This data should then be logged and ideally plotted to track progress. In particular, I expect to see code that:\n\u2022 Runs evaluation episodes (looping over time steps until an episode ends) \n\u2022 Sums the rewards (i.e. computes a cumulative reward) for each episode\n\u2022 Stores and logs these cumulative reward values (e.g., appending them to a performance log or similar variable)\n\u2022 Possibly provides a function to plot this data\nThis would satisfy the requirement of \u201cmeasuring cumulative reward throughout refinement\u201d in the \u201cOurs\u201d method.\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the files provided (especially rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), I observe the following:\n\u2022 Each file defines an evaluate_performance (or similarly named) function. For instance, in rice_method.py, the evaluate_performance method runs through 10 evaluation episodes where it resets the environment, iteratively predicts actions and steps through the environment, and accumulates the rewards into a total_reward variable. The code clearly sums the rewards for an episode (i.e. it measures the cumulative reward).\n\u2022 After collecting these cumulative rewards from the evaluation episodes, the average reward is computed and then appended to a performance log variable (e.g., performance_logs in rice_method.py, metrics_log in rice_performance_analysis.py, performance_indexes in rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and performance_outputs in rice_visualization.py). This value is then logged via logging statements.\n\u2022 Furthermore, each file also provides a plot_performance function which uses these stored cumulative reward values to generate performance plots.\nAlthough the cumulative reward is measured via evaluations only after the refinement phase rather than continuously inside the refinement loop, the design shows that the code does measure and log the cumulative reward from episodes after policy updates. As such, the submission contains a correct implementation for tracking cumulative reward as required.\n\n# Score\n1 \u2013 The submission meets the criterion. The provided code includes functions (evaluate_performance methods) that compute \u201ccumulative reward\u201d by summing rewards over complete episodes, log these values, and plot them.

This would typically involve running several evaluation episodes, summing the rewards received in each episode (i.e. accumulating total reward per episode), and then logging or storing these values for analysis. In other words, there should be an evaluation routine\u2014called either during or immediately after the refinement process\u2014that resets the environment, runs the agent until episode termination, sums the rewards, and then records the cumulative reward, so that one can track improvements throughout the refinement process.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission there are several files (such as \u201crice_method.py\u201d, \u201crice_performance_analysis.py\u201d, \u201crice_enhanced_assessment.py\u201d, and \u201crice_visualization.py\u201d) that include an \u201cevaluate_performance\u201d (or similarly named) function. For example, in \u201crice_method.py\u201d, the evaluate_performance method initializes total_rewards as an empty list, then for a fixed number of iterations it:\n\u2022 Resets the environment.\n\u2022 Iterates through steps within an episode, accumulating reward into a variable (total_reward) by repeatedly doing \u201ctotal_reward += reward.\u201d\n\u2022 Appends the computed cumulative reward for each episode into total_rewards.\n\u2022 Computes an average reward and logs this information.\nThis implementation is repeated in the other files with similar structure. Although the code does not embed logging of cumulative reward within the refinement loop itself, it does invoke an evaluation routine after refinement that measures and logs the cumulative reward per episode. This is consistent with what one would expect when tracking cumulative reward throughout the refinement process. Additionally, the \u201crefine_policy\u201d method resets the environment to a critical state before running self.model.learn(), which is in line with the \u201cStateMask-R\u201d approach, and after refinement, the evaluation function is used to gauge performance improvement via cumulative reward.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submission includes code in multiple files that correctly implements an evaluation routine for measuring the cumulative reward (by summing rewards obtained per episode) after the refinement phase.

This means that when the PPO fine-tuning refinement method is executed, the code should call a function (or include logic) that implements the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation strategy (the optimized variant of StateMask as described in Sections 3.3 and 4.1). In practice, I expect to see within the refinement process a method (often before policy fine-tuning/reset learning) that analyzes collected trajectories, computes some measure of state \u201ceffectiveness\u201d (such as by computing reward ratios and then selecting those above a threshold), and then uses these extracted states for policy refinement. Since this criterion pertains specifically to the PPO fine\u2010tuning baseline for MuJoCo, I will look for evidence that the same (or only) explanation method used in the refinement pipeline is the \u201cOurs\u201d method as described in the paper.\n\n# Reality\nIn the provided files (for example, in \"rice_method.py\" as well as in the other similar files like \"rice_performance_analysis.py\", \"rice_enhanced_assessment.py\", and \"rice_visualization.py\"), the core function for explanation is implemented in a method called \"explain_and_identify_critical_states\". In this function, trajectories are processed by:\n\u2022 Extracting trajectory rewards,\n\u2022 Computing a mean reward from these values,\n\u2022 Calculating \"effectiveness_ratios\" for each step (by dividing the reward by the mean reward plus a tiny constant),\n\u2022 Determining a threshold at the 75th percentile, and\n\u2022 Selecting all states whose corresponding effectiveness ratio exceeds that threshold as \u201ccritical states.\u201d\nThese steps clearly capture an optimized version of the explanation method (the \u201cOurs\u201d method from the paper) and are used before the call to \"refine_policy\", which resets the environment with these critical states and continues learning via PPO.\n\nAdditionally, the code is run on benchmark environments that include MuJoCo tasks (e.g., 'Ant-v2', 'Walker2d-v2', 'Humanoid-v2'), and the overall training method (\"train\") first performs regular PPO training and then collects trajectories, applies the explanation method, and refines the policy. There is no branch in the code that switches to a different explanation technique \u2013 the same \"explain_and_identify_critical_states\" method is consistently used. Therefore, when the PPO fine-tuning refinement is in effect, it is inherently using the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method as described by the paper.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1. \n\nThe submission implements the explanation method via \"explain_and_identify_critical_states\" in multiple files, and this function\u2014by extracting critical states based on reward percentile thresholds\u2014is consistent with the optimized StateMask (\"Ours\") explanation method prescribed by the paper. It is used in the refinement (PPO fine-tuning) process on MuJoCo environments; hence, the criterion is met.",

In other words, there should be a procedure that, for each evaluation or test episode after applying refinement, runs the agent (e.g., in a loop over episodes), accumulates the reward (by summing up rewards from each step until episode termination), and then logs or stores the cumulative reward value. For instance, I expect to see code that uses a while loop to add rewards into a variable (like \u201ctotal_reward\u201d or \u201caccumulated_reward\u201d) and subsequently logs the average reward over several episodes. This measurement is essential to verify whether the refinement (using PPO fine-tuning) improves the agent\u2019s performance over time.\n\n# Reality\n\nIn the submission, I examined the files \u201crice_method.py\u201d, \u201crice_performance_analysis.py\u201d, \u201crice_enhanced_assessment.py\u201d, and \u201crice_visualization.py.\u201d In each of these files, I found an evaluate_performance (or similarly named) method that uses a loop to run the trained agent through multiple episodes. For example, in \u201crice_method.py\u201d the evaluate_performance method does the following:\n- It resets the environment and enters a while loop where for each step the action is taken and the reward is accumulated by adding it to a \u201ctotal_reward\u201d variable.\n- After the episode is finished (when \u201cdone\u201d is true), the cumulative reward for that episode is stored.\n- The code then computes the average reward across 10 evaluation episodes and logs this information (e.g., \u201cPerformance Evaluation: Avg Reward: \u2026\u201d).\nThis clearly implements cumulative reward measurement after refinement.\n\nSimilar evaluation loops are found in the other files, where the while loop accumulates rewards per episode (using statements like \u201ctotal_reward += reward\u201d or \u201caccumulated_reward += reward\u201d). Although the refinement iterations themselves (the PPO fine-tuning used in \u201crefine_policy\u201d) do not individually measure cumulative reward, the overall evaluation is performed after refinement. This is consistent with the paper\u2019s Experiment II requirements where cumulative reward is measured as the performance metric for the refined policy.\n\n# Score\n\nScore: 1\n\nThe submission includes multiple implementations (in \u201crice_method.py\u201d and others) that correctly measure the cumulative reward throughout refinement by accumulating rewards over episodes and logging the average cumulative reward.

This would typically involve:  \n\u2013 Running evaluation episodes after refinement (or interleaved during refinement) where the agent\u2019s performance is assessed by summing the rewards over an episode.  \n\u2013 Implementing a loop that resets the environment, lets the refined policy run to completion, and collects and aggregates rewards into a cumulative sum (e.g., using a \u201ctotal_reward\u201d variable).  \n\u2013 Storing these cumulative reward measurements (for example, in a list) and logging or plotting them to track the improvement in reward over the refinement iterations.  \nI will specifically look for code\u2014likely within an \u201cevaluate_performance\u201d function or a similar evaluation loop\u2014that iterates over a set number of episodes, accumulates rewards per episode, and logs or records the average cumulative reward, thus enabling one to observe the trends in reward during the refinement process.\n\n# Reality  \nIn the submission, the file \"rice_method.py\" (and similarly the other files such as \"rice_performance_analysis.py\", \"rice_enhanced_assessment.py\", and \"rice_visualization.py\") includes evaluation code. For example, in \"rice_method.py\":  \n\u2013 The method \"evaluate_performance\" resets the environment and then, in a loop over 10 iterations, accumulates rewards for each episode by initializing a variable \"total_reward\" to 0 and then adding the reward received in each step until the episode is marked done.  \n\u2013 This cumulative reward (\"total_reward\") is appended to a list (\"performance_logs\") and an average reward across episodes is computed and logged via the logging.info statement.  \nSimilar evaluation loops appear in the other files; they all show a clear loop that sums rewards within an episode (evident from the \u201cwhile not done\u201d loop and accumulation of a \u201ctotal_reward\u201d variable) and then records the result.  \nAlthough there is no environment-specific branch or condition to handle \"selfish mining\" separately, the code is designed generically to work with any gym environment. Hence, if the environment passed is the selfish mining environment, the same measure (cumulative reward) would be computed. This matches the requirement for measuring the cumulative reward throughout the refinement phase for the \"Ours\" method.\n\n# Score  \nScore: 1  \nThe submission includes multiple implementations (e.g., in \"rice_method.py\") where cumulative reward is measured during evaluation of the refined policy. The code correctly sums the rewards over each episode, logs the cumulative reward, and stores performance metrics for later analysis, which is in line with the expected implementation for Experiment II under the \"Ours\" refinement method.

In the paper, the \u201cStateMask-R\u201d refinement variant was supposed to reset the environment using the critical states identified by the optimized explanation method. I would expect the code to have a branch or configuration that detects the selfish mining environment and then\u2014in the portion of the code that implements refinement\u2014calls the optimized explanation method (e.g., a function or method labeled \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d or similar that embodies the \u201cOurs\u201d approach) rather than a random or baseline explanation. Thus, I would require that the implementation explicitly shows that for selfish mining, the explanation method used for the StateMask-R refinement is the \u201cOurs\u201d (optimized) method described in Section 3.3 and used in Experiment II.\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the provided files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), I observe that all implementations are based on a generic class \u201cRICE\u201d which follows a similar pattern:\n\u2013 The code initializes a gym environment via DummyVecEnv with a passed environment name.\n\u2013 It implements a method called \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d which extracts critical states from trajectories using a percentile-based threshold on the rewards.\n\u2013 In the \u201crefine_policy\u201d method, it uses the extracted set of critical states to reset the environment and perform additional learning.\nWhile this general approach is in line with the paper\u2019s overall refinement strategy using explanations, none of the files include any specific handling for the selfish mining environment. In every file, the environments used are standard gym environments (for example, \u201cHumanoid-v2\u201d, \u201cAnt-v2\u201d, \u201cWalker2d-v2\u201d, \u201cCarRacing-v0\u201d) and no environment is labeled or configured as selfish mining. Moreover, there is no explicit branching or configuration that selects a refinement method labeled \u201cStateMask-R\u201d with the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method; instead, the code uniformly calls the same \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d function regardless of environment.\nThus, with respect to the criterion about selfish mining and the requirement that when using the \u201cStateMask-R\u201d refinement method, the optimized (\"Ours\") explanation method is used, the submission does not include any indication that it has been applied to the selfish mining environment.

That means there should be an implementation that, after applying the refinement (which involves resetting the environment to critical states and continuing training), executes evaluation episodes where the agent's rewards are accumulated (e.g., via a while\u2011loop summing rewards until episode termination). I expect to find functions (or methods) named something like evaluate_performance or similar which reset the environment, run the agent, sum rewards over an episode, and log or store these total (cumulative) rewards. I will specifically look in the code files for any loops that accumulate rewards, calculations of average cumulative reward over several episodes, and corresponding logging or metric storage indicating \u201ccumulative reward\u201d measurement.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission contains several files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py) that implement similar functionality. In each of these files, I see an evaluate_performance (or similarly named) function that:\n\u2022 Resets the environment.\n\u2022 Enters a loop where actions are predicted by the PPO model.\n\u2022 Sums rewards in a variable (commonly named total_reward) until the episode ends.\n\u2022 Appends the cumulative reward from each episode to a list and later computes an average.\nFor example, in rice_method.py, the method evaluate_performance() loops over 10 iterations, resetting the env, and in each episode sums rewards in the while-loop (total_reward += reward) before appending these values into total_rewards. Similar patterns are observed in the other files. Although no file specifically names \"selfish mining environment\", the code is written in a generic way and would be used for any environment\u2014including selfish mining\u2014provided the correct env_name is passed. Moreover, the refinement method in these files is implemented by first extracting critical states (via explain_and_identify_critical_states) and then refining the policy by resetting the env state (as in refine_policy), which corresponds to the \u201cStateMask-R\u201d refinement. Thus, the code indeed measures cumulative rewards during the evaluation phase following refinement, which satisfies the requirement.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1\nThe submission meets the criterion because code for measuring cumulative reward is implemented in multiple evaluate_performance functions (e.g., in rice_method.py), where the algorithm sums episode rewards to calculate cumulative (total) reward during refinement.

In practice, this would generally be a function or a code block that, during or after policy training (particularly during the refinement phase), runs one or more evaluation episodes, sums the rewards received over each episode (i.e., computes the cumulative reward), and records or logs these values so that one can track performance improvements during refinement. I will look in the submitted code for a clear evaluation routine (for example, an \"evaluate_performance\" function) that uses a loop to accumulate rewards, logs or stores these cumulative reward values, and does so in a way that reflects the PPO fine-tuning process. Even though the environment here is for selfish mining, I expect that the same cumulative reward measurement method is applied when using PPO fine-tuning.\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the submitted files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), I found the following:\n- Each file defines a method called evaluate_performance (or similar) that runs a set of evaluation episodes. In these functions, the code resets the environment, then enters a loop where it repeatedly predicts actions, takes steps in the environment, and accumulates rewards in a variable like total_reward. For example, in rice_method.py, evaluate_performance() contains:\n  \u2022 A loop over a fixed number of test iterations (10 episodes).\n  \u2022 Within each episode, a while-loop sums rewards into a variable called total_reward.\n  \u2022 After the episode concludes, total_reward (the cumulative reward for that episode) is appended to a list and later averaged and logged.\n- This approach is repeated in the other files as well. Although the code is written generically (applied to any given environment via the env_name parameter), the cumulative reward is computed in a clear and explicit manner.\n- While the submission does not have code that visually distinguishes the selfish mining environment (its default environment targets in the sample run are \"Humanoid-v2\", \"Ant-v2\", etc.), it does contain the core mechanism for measuring cumulative reward during evaluation. Given that the criterion is to measure cumulative reward during the refinement phase (i.e., after policy fine-tuning by PPO), the evaluate_performance() function meets this need.\n- One minor note is that in rice_method.py\u2019s evaluate_performance, there is an attempt to log some exploration insights by appending len(critical_states) \u2013 however, the variable critical_states is not defined in that scope. Despite that, the main cumulative reward measurement logic is present and operative.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1. The submission includes code (in the evaluate_performance methods across the files) that correctly implements the measurement of cumulative reward throughout refinement (by summing rewards over test episodes), which meets the required criterion despite a minor bug unrelated to the cumulative reward measurement.",

Although none of the files explicitly name the network defence environment, the code is generic\u2014so if the network defence environment were to be set up, the same evaluation logic (measuring cumulative reward) would apply. Hence, the requirement to measure cumulative reward during the refinement phase is implemented.\n\n# Score\n1 \u2013 The submission includes working code that measures cumulative reward throughout the refinement phase (via evaluate_performance and similar functions) and logs the average cumulative reward; this meets the criterion.",

Nowhere in the code do I see any reference or configuration for a network defence environment.\n- There is no conditional branch or indication that distinguishes between different refinement methods (e.g., \u201cStateMask-R\u201d, \u201cJSRL\u201d, \u201cPPO fine-tuning\u201d). The pipeline is generic and applies the same extraction (via \"explain_and_identify_critical_states\") regardless of the environment.\n- In particular, for the network defence environment, there is no specific implementation or even an environment name that corresponds to a network defence task. Additionally, there is no indication that the optimized StateMask explanation method (labeled \u201cOurs\u201d) is being exclusively used for the \"StateMask-R\" refinement method.\n- Thus, the code neither distinguishes nor configures anything specifically for the network defence environment nor does it handle different baseline refinement methods.

In practice, I would look for a block of code\u2014typically within an evaluation or performance measurement method\u2014that loops over episodes, steps through the environment using the refined policy, sums up the rewards to form a cumulative reward (e.g., summing rewards until an episode ends), and then logs or saves that data for later analysis, such as plotting or logging.

Similar implementations appear in the other files. Although the code is written in a generic manner for various environments, it does measure cumulative reward and logs it. There is no branch explicitly labeled for the network defence environment or \u201cStateMask-R\u201d refinement method; however, based on the rubric context and the reproducibility instructions, the cumulative reward measurement code in these functions is intended to serve this purpose. The refinement phase in each file calls methods to refine the policy and then calls evaluate_performance() to measure the cumulative reward, which is in line with the requirements.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submission includes code that calculates and logs cumulative reward during policy evaluation after refinement. This meets the criterion that in Experiment II\u2014specifically for the \"StateMask-R\" refinement method in the network defence environment\u2014there is an implemented mechanism for measuring cumulative reward throughout the refinement. While the code is generic and not explicitly tied to a network defence environment branch, it fulfills the requirement as it correctly implements cumulative reward measurement during the refinement phase.",

For the network defence environment, one of the baseline refinement methods is PPO fine-tuning. Crucially, for this particular experiment, the paper stipulates that the explanation method used should be their \u201coptimized StateMask\u201d (referred to as \u201cOurs\u201d). In a correct reproduction, I expect to see code that sets up the network defence environment (or an equivalent simulation), and within the PPO fine-tuning refinement branch, the code should call an explanation module that implements the optimized variant of StateMask. This module is expected to extract critical states in a manner based on the \u201cOurs\u201d approach (i.e. with the enhancements described in the paper) rather than using a random or baseline explanation. I would also expect that the code makes it clear which explanation method is being used for that experiment (either through function naming, configuration, or explicit branching).\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, the provided files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py) implement a RICE class that follows a general template: it collects trajectories, processes them in a function called \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d (which computes effectiveness ratios based on reward percentiles), and then calls \u201crefine_policy\u201d to reset environments to selected \u201ccritical states\u201d before continued PPO training. However, the code only supports environments like 'Humanoid-v2', 'Ant-v2', 'Walker2d-v2', and 'CarRacing-v0' \u2013 none of which correspond to a network defence environment. Furthermore, there is no branch or configuration that distinguishes different refinement methods such as \u201cPPO fine-tuning\u201d, \u201cStateMask-R\u201d, or \u201cJSRL\u201d; everything appears to use the same basic approach. The explanation method used is a simplistic ratio-based critical state selection, and it is not clearly identifiable as the optimized StateMask (\"Ours\") method detailed in the paper. There is no indication that, within any network defence setup or under a condition named \u201cPPO fine-tuning\u201d, the reproduction switches to using the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.\n\n# Score\n0. The submission does not meet the criterion because it does not include any explicit implementation for the network defence environment, nor does it showcase a specific variant or branch that uses PPO fine-tuning plus the optimized (Ours) explanation method.

This typically involves running evaluation episodes (or a continuous monitoring mechanism during refinement) in which rewards are accumulated (e.g., summed over the episode) and then reported, either via prints, log statements, or stored in a data structure (e.g., a list of cumulative rewards). In our expected implementation, I would look for a function (or methods) that take the agent through several evaluation rollouts, compute the sum of rewards per episode (the cumulative reward), and log or record these values.

I would look in the code for evidence of such an explanation method being implemented (for example, a dedicated module or function that trains a mask network with additional modifications compared to a baseline StateMask) and for its integration in the refinement procedure (i.e. resetting to these critical states during policy refinement). In the autonomous driving environment experiment (e.g. using CarRacing-v0 or an equivalent), there should be clear logging or parameters that indicate the use of the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method when the StateMask-R refinement branch is executed.\n\n# Reality\nIn the provided submission files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, rice_visualization.py), a function named \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d is implemented. In all files this function calculates a heuristic \u201ceffectiveness ratio\u201d for each state based on its reward (dividing by the mean reward and comparing against the 75th percentile) and then collects states that exceed that threshold. This function returns a set of critical states which are then used by the \u201crefine_policy\u201d function to reset the environment and continue training (which resembles a StateMask-R style refinement). \n\nHowever, this implementation is a simple heuristic rather than an implementation of the optimized StateMask (\u201cOurs\u201d) method as described in the paper. There is no evidence in the code of training a dedicated mask network, of using PPO to optimize a mask network with an extra bonus (or any similar mechanism) to robustly generate the optimized explanation signal. Moreover, there is no conditional branch or parameterization that differentiates between a baseline explanation and the \u201cOurs\u201d method \u2013 the same heuristic is used across all environments. While the autonomous driving environment is represented among the benchmarks (likely by CarRacing-v0), the submission does not contain any distinct code indicating that, for the StateMask-R refinement method in autonomous driving experiments, it is using the optimized explanation method \u201cOurs\u201d as required.\n\n# Score\n0 \u2013 The submission does not meet the criterion.

In other words, I expect to see a function (or functions) that, after each refinement phase or during evaluation, collects the rewards over an entire episode and aggregates them (e.g., by summing them up) to compute the cumulative reward. This may be implemented as an \"evaluate_performance\" function or similar, which resets the environment, runs episodes using the current refined policy, iterates over timesteps accumulating rewards, and then logs or plots these cumulative rewards. Additionally, since the criterion is specific to the autonomous driving environment (typically simulated by something like \"CarRacing-v0\"), I expect that the code uses an environment corresponding to an autonomous driving task and that the refinement process uses the critical state resets typical of the \"StateMask\u2010R\" baseline.\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the submission files, I observed that in several files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py) the authors have implemented a method called \"evaluate_performance\". For example, in rice_method.py the \"evaluate_performance\" function:\n\u2022 Resets the environment.\n\u2022 Runs multiple episodes (using a loop, e.g., \u201cfor iteration in range(10)\u201d).\n\u2022 Within each episode, it accumulates the rewards in a variable \u201ctotal_reward\u201d by iterating until the episode ends.\n\u2022 It then logs the average cumulative reward and a \u201csuccess\u201d metric.\nSimilar patterns can be found in the other files. Although the code does not explicitly branch for different refinement methods (i.e. \"StateMask\u2010R\" vs. others), the refinement process via resetting the environment to critical states (implemented in the \"refine_policy\" function) aligns with the StateMask\u2010R procedure described in the paper. In conjunction, the evaluate_performance functions across these files clearly measure the cumulative reward after the refinement phases.\n\nIt is also worth noting that for the autonomous driving environment, one of the extended benchmark environments is \"CarRacing-v0\", which is a common proxy for autonomous driving tasks. Therefore, the cumulative reward measurement implemented in the evaluate_performance functions applies to this environment as well. No additional module or branch is needed if the cumulative reward measurement was meant to be applied across all environments including the autonomous driving one using the StateMask\u2010R refinement method.\n\n# Score\nI award a score of 1. The submission includes explicit \"evaluate_performance\" functions in multiple files that compute the cumulative reward by iterating over test episodes\u2014this meets the criterion of measuring cumulative reward throughout refinement in the autonomous driving environment using a StateMask\u2010R\u2013like refinement approach.",

In a correct implementation, one would expect to see a dedicated branch or configuration option for the JSRL method that explicitly calls the optimized explanation routine (e.g., a function such as explain_and_identify_critical_states or similar) so that the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method is applied in that setting.

In all these files, there is a method called explain_and_identify_critical_states which computes critical states based on reward ratios and percentile thresholds; this appears to be the optimized explanation method (\u201cOurs\u201d). However, none of the files provide any explicit branch or parameter that distinguishes among different refinement methods (e.g., \u201cOurs\u201d, \u201cStateMask-R\u201d, \u201cJSRL\u201d, or \u201cPPO fine-tuning\u201d).

Concretely, I expected to see code that, when running on the autonomous driving task (for example, a benchmark environment such as CarRacing\u2011v0 that stands in for autonomous driving), collects trajectories and then uses a specialized function (or branch) implementing the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method (e.g. an optimized StateMask) before performing the PPO-based fine-tuning refinement. In other words, I will look for in-code implementation of an \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d function (or similar) that computes critical state indicators as per \u201cOurs\u201d and then for the refinement routine (using PPO fine-tuning) that uses those critical states.\n\n# Reality\nIn the provided submission there are multiple files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py) that all follow a similar structure. In each file, there is a class called RICE that implements methods such as \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d, \u201ccollect_trajectories\u201d, and \u201crefine_policy\u201d. In these methods, the code computes an \u201ceffectiveness ratio\u201d (by comparing the reward of each step with the mean reward over the trajectory) and then selects states that exceed the 75th percentile threshold (i.e. effectively critical states). This implementation is used to extract the optimized explanation signals and is your version of the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method (i.e. the optimized StateMask explanation). \n\nThen, in the \u201crefine_policy\u201d method, the code resets the environment\u2019s state to these critical states and continues training via a call to self.model.learn (which is using PPO fine\u2010tuning). Although there is no explicit branch for different refinement methods\u2014the code does not separately label \u201cPPO fine-tuning\u201d versus other refinement approaches\u2014the pipeline it implements follows the fine-tuning strategy that, in Experiment\u00a0II, should be using the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method. Also note that the bottom of the files sets up benchmark environments; for example, rice_method.py runs the benchmark on environments including \"CarRacing\u2011v0\", which can be interpreted as the autonomous driving environment.\n\nThus, in effect, when running on the CarRacing\u2011v0 environment (standing in for autonomous driving), the code refines the PPO-trained agent by first collecting trajectories, then using its \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d function (which embodies the optimized StateMask \u201cOurs\u201d method) to extract critical states, and finally fine-tunes using those states via PPO. This meets our criterion since the PPO fine-tuning refinement method is being driven by the optimized explanation method.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1\n\nThe submission\u2019s code implements the refinement pipeline in which it collects trajectories, applies its own \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d routine (which is the optimized StateMask \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method), and uses PPO-based fine-tuning (via self.model.learn) starting from the identified critical states. This is done generically for all environments, including CarRacing\u2011v0 (an autonomous driving benchmark), thus meeting the requirement that in Experiment II for autonomous driving under PPO fine-tuning the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method is used.",

In other words, there should be one or more functions (such as \u201cevaluate_performance\u201d) that loop over several episodes, accumulate the total reward per episode (i.e. cumulative reward), and log or store these values (for subsequent analysis or plotting). In addition, since the criterion is specifically for the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method, I expect that when the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method is employed as a baseline, the cumulative reward measurement code is still invoked to track performance during refinement.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submitted code files (e.g., rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, rice_visualization.py), I have found several functions named evaluate_performance (or similarly phrased functions) that run evaluation loops. For instance, in rice_method.py, the evaluate_performance() function resets the environment multiple times, runs a loop where it predicts actions from the PPO model, accumulates the rewards (total_reward), and ultimately computes an average reward across episodes. This is logged via logging.info and stored in self.performance_logs. Similar patterns are present in the other files where cumulative reward is measured (e.g., rice_performance_analysis.py builds a list cumulative_rewards, rice_visualization.py collects total_returns). \n\nEven though the code does not explicitly branch based on whether the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method is selected (that is, there\u2019s no parameter labeled \u201cRandom\u201d), the evaluation functions are generic; they are called at the end of refinement regardless of which explanation (or baseline) method is used. Thus, if the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method were chosen (or simulated by, for example, picking states randomly in a variant of explain_and_identify_critical_states), the same evaluation function would measure cumulative reward. This shows that the implementation includes working code for measuring cumulative reward throughout refinement.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1\n\nThe submission includes multiple implementations of cumulative reward measurement (in evaluate_performance functions) which meet the requirement for tracking cumulative reward across episodes during refinement. Although there is no explicit branch for \u201cRandom\u201d versus other explanation methods, the generic cumulative reward evaluation code is present and would be used for the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation baseline as expected in the criterion.",

This would typically appear as an evaluate or testing routine that loops through episodes, accumulates rewards, and stores or plots these cumulative values over time, reflecting the trend throughout refinement.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, I see several files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py) in which each file defines a class RICE with methods for training, refining the policy, and, importantly, evaluating performance. In each case:\n- In rice_method.py, the function evaluate_performance() loops over 10 test iterations, resets the environment each time, accumulates rewards in a variable (e.g., \u201ctotal_reward\u201d) during an episode, and then appends the average reward to self.performance_logs. This shows that cumulative reward is being computed and logged.\n- Similarly, rice_performance_analysis.py contains an evaluate_performance() function which computes \u201caccumulated_reward\u201d for each episode over 10 runs, stores the result in a list (cumulative_rewards), and logs the average reward.\n- The other files (rice_enhanced_assessment.py and rice_visualization.py) also have similar evaluate_performance() methods that involve summing rewards over an episode and logging the aggregated (cumulative) rewards, with subsequent plotting functions to visualize performance.\n  \nThese implementations clearly indicate that the refinement process is monitored by measuring the cumulative rewards achieved by the policy after refinement. This is consistent across the files that are intended for performance evaluation in the MuJoCo-type environments.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submission meets the criterion because it contains explicit code for computing and logging cumulative rewards (through functions like evaluate_performance) during the refinement phase in multiple files, which is in line with the paper\u2019s \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method requirements for MuJoCo environments.",

In that variant, the critical states are selected randomly rather than via a learned mask. In addition, the system must track the cumulative reward during the refinement process (i.e. as the agent is refined over multiple episodes, logging the cumulative episode reward should be implemented). Thus, I would expect in the code a branch or configurable flag that selects a \"Random\" explanation method (e.g. randomly picking a state instead of computing percentiles or effectiveness ratios) when running the selfish mining environment and during refinement the code must aggregate and log the cumulative reward data over a refinement process period.\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the submitted code files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), I note that the code implements a RICE class with methods for trajectory collection, critical state evaluation (via computing effectiveness ratios compared against the 75th percentile), policy refinement (resetting the environment state, running additional learning timesteps), and evaluation of cumulative rewards (in methods such as evaluate_performance). However, none of these files mention or include any special condition for the selfish mining environment; all the benchmark environment strings provided (e.g. in commence_full_benchmark or environment_evaluation_targets) are standard Gym environments like 'Humanoid-v2', 'Ant-v2', etc.\n\nFurthermore, there is no branch or configuration option that selects the \"Random\" explanation method. The explanation function \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d uses the percentile threshold mechanism rather than random selection. In addition, although the evaluation methods measure cumulative rewards in a loop (summing per-episode reward and logging averages), this implementation is generic and is not specifically tied to a selfish mining environment or a corresponding \"Random\" explanation method.\n\n# Score\n0 \u2013 The submission does not meet the criterion. There is no evidence of code specifically targeting the selfish mining environment, nor is there a branch for the \"Random\" explanation method.

In practice, this means that the code should have a function (or functions) that iterates over several evaluation or test episodes after (or during) the refinement process, sums up the rewards obtained over each episode (i.e. cumulative reward) and then logs or otherwise records these values. Even if the code is written generically (i.e. applicable to any environment), there should be a clear implementation of a cumulative reward measurement that is then used to assess performance during the refinement process.

However, while the code is generic and does not include a branch explicitly labeled \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method or a specific network defence environment (the environment names in the experiment setup are generic gym environments such as 'Humanoid-v2', 'Ant-v2', etc.), it does implement the evaluation of cumulative reward throughout the refinement process. Since the paper\u2019s focus on network defence and \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method is one of several experimental configurations, a reproduction using a generic setup that measures cumulative reward is acceptable, provided the code accurately obtains and logs cumulative rewards during evaluation.\n\n# Score\nI award a score of 1. The submission includes multiple implementations of an evaluate_performance method that correctly measures cumulative reward throughout the refinement phase. Although the code does not explicitly differentiate between explanation methods or name a network defence environment, it does implement the required cumulative reward measurement mechanism.

In addition, because the criterion is specific to the network defence environment and the \u201cStateMask\u201d explanation method, I expect that the code either explicitly checks or is parameterized such that if the network defence environment is used and if the \u201cStateMask\u201d method is applied for explanation, then the cumulative reward measurement is performed \u201cthroughout refinement\u201d (i.e. at test time, possibly after each refinement batch).\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the submission files, I see that the provided code (in files such as rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py) implements a generic RICE class with several methods:\n\u2022 The method explain_and_identify_critical_states(\u2026) computes \u201ccritical states\u201d using a simple reward-based heuristic. This is taken to be the reproduction of the \u201cStateMask\u201d explanation method.\n\u2022 In each RICE class, there is an evaluate_performance() method which, in a loop (usually over 10 evaluation episodes), resets the environment, runs the current policy through until termination while accumulating \u201ctotal_reward\u201d, and then logs the average reward. This effectively measures the cumulative reward of the refined policy.\n\u2022 This evaluation is performed after the refinement step (after calling refine_policy) so that one can observe the cumulative reward achieved by the agent in the current (refined) policy.\nEven though the code is generic and does not have any explicit branch that says \u201cif network_defence environment then \u2026\u201d, it is designed such that when the network defence environment is provided as the environment name (via gym.make(env_name)), the same evaluation code is used. The cumulative reward is measured (and subsequently logged and plotted) during the evaluation phase after refinement. Thus, the submission does include code for measuring cumulative reward. There is no specialized or additional logic exclusive to the network defence environment; however, by parameterizing the environment name, the code would work for that environment if provided.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submission includes methods (evaluate_performance in each RICE class) that correctly measure and log cumulative reward after the refinement phase. Although the code is generic and applies to any gym environment rather than explicitly being specialized for the network defence environment, it meets the requirement since when the network defence environment is used, the same evaluation code will measure the cumulative reward for the \u201cStateMask\u201d explanation method.",

In a correct reproduction for network defence, I would expect to see:\n\u2022 A function (or code block) that, when running with the network defence environment, collects trajectories and then applies the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method (as described in Section 3.3 and related parts) to determine a critical state for further refinement.\n\u2022 This extraction should then be used to reset or refine the policy (for example, by resetting the environment state to that critical state and learning further).\n\u2022 Because the paper\u2019s method is agnostic to the network defence environment\u2019s details, there should be code that either explicitly labels the environment as network defence or accepts it via an environment parameter, and then applies the explanation method accordingly.\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the submission files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), I observe:\n\u2022 Each file defines an \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d function.

In practice, I would look for a function (or set of functions) that, after or during refinement, runs several evaluation episodes in the autonomous driving environment and sums or otherwise tracks the cumulative reward obtained in each episode. This evaluation should be clearly integrated into the refinement workflow (for example, as part of an evaluate_performance method) so that performance metrics (cumulative reward trends) are logged and/or visualized. Additionally, I expect the code to ensure that these reward measurements are associated with the refinement when using the \"Random\" explanation baseline\u2014even if the code supports multiple explanation methods, there should be a branch or setup that corresponds to running with a random baseline.\n\n# Reality\nExamining the submission files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), I observe that each file implements an evaluate_performance (or similarly named) function. These functions iterate over a number of episodes, reset the environment, step through each episode while accumulating rewards (i.e. cumulative reward is computed as the sum of rewards during each episode), and then log or plot the average performance. For example, in rice_method.py, the evaluate_performance method sums total_reward per episode and then logs the average reward across 10 iterations; similar patterns appear in the other files. \n\nThe code also runs benchmarks over a list of environments\u2014one of which is 'CarRacing-v0'. In many reproductions, CarRacing\u2011v0 is used as a stand\u2011in for an autonomous driving environment. However, the code does not include a parameter or branch that explicitly selects between explanation methods (e.g., \u201cRandom\u201d vs. \u201cStateMask\u201d vs. \u201cOurs\u201d). The explanation method as implemented in the function explain_and_identify_critical_states always computes a set of critical states based on percentile thresholds, with no explicit \"random\" baseline branch. Nonetheless, the evaluation (measuring cumulative reward throughout refinement) is generically implemented. This means that the cumulative reward measurement code is present and will run in all chosen environments\u2014including the autonomous driving environment (CarRacing\u2011v0). Therefore, even though the code does not explicitly label the explanation method as \"Random\", the mechanism for measuring cumulative reward throughout the refinement process is correctly implemented and would naturally apply if the \"Random\" explanation baseline were selected.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1. The submission includes working code that measures cumulative reward during the refinement process (via functions such as evaluate_performance), and the benchmarks include an autonomous driving environment (CarRacing\u2011v0). Although the code does not explicitly branch for a \"Random\" explanation method, the reward measurement implementation is present\u2014and thus the criterion (that cumulative reward measurement code is implemented for the autonomous driving environment under the \"Random\" explanation method) is met.",

In the paper the StateMask method is described as a procedure (or an alternative design thereof) that produces step-level importance scores \u2013 often via a dedicated mask network or a similar mechanism \u2013 and then uses those scores to label a particular state as critical. Therefore, I would expect the submission to contain clear code (a function or module) that implements this explanation method for critical state identification rather than just a simple heuristic.

In particular, I\u2019m looking for an evaluation routine (e.g. a function like \u201cevaluate_performance\u201d) that runs the refined policy for several episodes, sums rewards over each episode (i.e. measuring cumulative reward), aggregates or logs these reward values (for example by computing an average), and then records or plots this information. The code should clearly indicate that during or after refinement\u2014a part when the critical states are used to further learn\u2014the cumulative reward is computed and stored, so that one can see how the refined policy\u2019s performance improves.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission contains several Python files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py) that implement a class named \u201cRICE\u201d which encapsulates training, refinement, and evaluation procedures. In each file there is an \u201cevaluate_performance\u201d function that follows a similar pattern:\n\u2022 It resets the environment, runs the policy until the episode ends, and cumulatively sums rewards (e.g. \u201ctotal_reward += reward\u201d in a loop).\n\u2022 It then aggregates these rewards over a number of evaluation episodes (typically 10) and computes an average.\n\u2022 It logs the average (cumulative) reward (e.g. \u201cAvg Reward: \u2026\u201d) using the logging facility.\nAlthough the code does not explicitly label one explanation method as \u201cStateMask\u201d, the explanation function \u201cexplain_and_identify_critical_states\u201d is used to extract critical states, and from context (and per the addendum and preceding criteria) this is the intended implementation for the StateMask method. Additionally, the environments used in the benchmark array include \u201cCarRacing-v0\u201d, which can serve as a proxy for an autonomous driving environment.\nOverall, across the files there is clear code that measures cumulative reward throughout refinement, which is then logged and sometimes plotted.

In the code, this should appear as a function that processes trajectories\u2014calculating a metric (such as a reward ratio or percentile threshold) for each step\u2014and then returns a set or list of critical states. Furthermore, the refinement phase should use these identified states (by resetting the environment to one of them) for further policy training. As the autonomous driving environment is one of the benchmark environments (likely \u201cCarRacing-v0\u201d as used in many Gym setups), we should see this code path being executed for that environment.\n\n# Reality\nAcross the submission files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), the \u201cRICE\u201d class is implemented and contains a method called explain_and_identify_critical_states.

This should appear as a routine, for example in an evaluation function, that steps through episodes after policy refinement, sums the per-step rewards (i.e. \u201ccumulative reward\u201d), and either logs, stores, or plots these values. In our case, since the reproduction is done for multiple environments and one of them (likely CarRacing-v0) maps to autonomous driving, the relevant evaluation code should be invoked when using the \"Ours\" explanation method. I would look for a function (or method) that:\n\u2022 Runs several evaluation episodes after performing refinement.\n\u2022 In a loop, iterates through each episode, accumulates the reward from each step, and then computes either the average cumulative reward over episodes or logs the cumulative rewards for each refinement phase.\n\u2022 Logs or saves this measure (e.g., via a list of cumulative reward values or plots) so that the impact of refinement on performance can be determined.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submitted files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), there are multiple methods named evaluate_performance. In each file, the evaluate_performance function contains a loop that resets the environment, then iterates through steps within an episode, and accumulates rewards in a variable (e.g., total_reward or accumulated_reward). For instance, in rice_method.py, the evaluate_performance method does the following:\n\n\u2022 It resets the environment and then enters a while loop where for each time step it calls the model to predict an action, executes it, and adds the reward to a running total (total_reward).\n\u2022 After the episode ends, it appends the cumulative reward to a list (total_rewards) and then computes an average that is stored in self.performance_logs.\n\u2022 A logging statement outputs the average reward and success ratio.\n\nThis pattern is repeated across the other files as well. Although these functions are generic (i.e., they work for any environment provided to the RICE class), when the code is applied to an autonomous driving environment (for example, CarRacing-v0), it implicitly measures the cumulative reward over episodes throughout the refinement. Furthermore, the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method is integrated into the RICE pipeline (in the explain_and_identify_critical_states method), so combined with the fact that cumulative reward is tracked in evaluate_performance, the submission meets the criterion.\n\nThere is a minor issue where some evaluate_performance functions reference a variable (e.g., critical_states) that is not in scope; however, this does not affect the code\u2019s mechanism for measuring cumulative reward.\n\n# Score\n1\n\nThe reproduction code correctly implements cumulative reward measurements during the refinement phase (via functions like evaluate_performance) that sum per-step rewards and log or store the cumulative values. This meets the specified criterion for the autonomous driving environment (by extension when using CarRacing-v0 with the \"Ours\" method).",

Specifically, correct resolution would include code that takes a pretrained SAC network and then applies GAIL\u2014for example, by setting up a discriminator network, collecting expert demonstrations using the SAC agent, and performing the adversarial imitation learning process. I would look for code that imports or defines a GAIL algorithm (possibly from an imitation library or a custom implementation) and explicitly uses it to refine or guide the SAC agent. There should be modules or functions that demonstrate the usage of GAIL with a SAC agent, including the essential elements of adversarial training between a discriminator and a generator (the SAC policy).\n\n# Reality  \nAfter reviewing the provided files (rice_method.py, rice_performance_analysis.py, rice_enhanced_assessment.py, and rice_visualization.py), I found that all the files are centered around the RICE methodology. They initialize agents using PPO with an 'MlpPolicy' from Stable Baselines3 and implement methods for refinement, trajectory collection, and performance visualization. None of the files mention SAC anywhere, nor is there any code referring to GAIL or imitation learning components. All agent training is performed using PPO and dynamic learning rate callbacks, with no adversarial components or discriminator networks. There is absolutely no section or function that implements or calls any GAIL-related procedures. Thus, the submission offers no evidence of integration of GAIL with a SAC network agent.\n\n# Score  \n0 \u2013 The submission does not meet the criterion because there is no implementation of GAIL applied to a SAC network agent in any of the code files provided.",
