There is no code present that specifically implements any PPO fine-tuning, nor is there any lowering of the learning rate or specialization for the selfish mining environment.\n\u2022 The README.md only states \u201cStep 1: Implement environment setup and RICE algorithm\u201d without any elaboration.\n\u2022 The test.py file only prints the current working directory.\n\u2022 The run_RICE.sh file is a simple Bash script that calls python on RICE.py.\nNone of these files contain any implementation details that address the selfish mining environment or the PPO fine-tuning refinement method (i.e., no code that lowers the learning rate and continues training the PPO agent).\n\n# Score\nScore: 0\n\nThe submission does not include any actual implementation for the PPO fine-tuning refinement method for the selfish mining environment; the provided code is only a placeholder without any details meeting the criterion.",
