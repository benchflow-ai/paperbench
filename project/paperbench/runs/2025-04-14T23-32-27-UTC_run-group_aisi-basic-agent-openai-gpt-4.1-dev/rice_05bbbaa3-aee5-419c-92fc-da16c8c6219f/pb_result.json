In practice, this means that the code should define a loss function which effectively maximizes the reward (or expected return) when the mask is applied. For example, one acceptable approach is to use a loss of \u2013(reward + bonus) so that minimizing the loss is equivalent to maximizing \u03b7(\u03c0\u0304). I will look in the code files for evidence that, at least in the training routine for the mask network (and by extension in the MuJoCo experiments), the objective is set up to maximize \u03b7(\u03c0\u0304) rather than minimizing some different criterion.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, the file \"rice/explanation/train_mask_network.py\" contains the training loop for the mask network. In that file, after computing the output from the mask network, the code applies a simple scheme: if the mask network output indicates \u201cblind\u201d (mask_action equals 1), then a random action is taken; additionally, a bonus term (using the provided hyperparameter alpha) is added to the reward. The key line is:\n\u2003\u2003loss = \u2013torch.tensor([reward_prime], requires_grad=True)\nThis loss function is directly the negative of the current reward (augmented by the bonus), so that when the optimizer minimizes this loss, it in effect maximizes the reward. This positive reward maximization directly corresponds to the objective J(\u03b8) = max \u03b7(\u03c0\u0304) specified in section 3.3. The README.md also explicitly states that the objective and reward bonus are implemented \u201cas in the paper.\u201d While the code is relatively simple and does not use a more complex policy-gradient or PPO-based update for the mask network, it still performs the maximization of the expected reward which is equivalent to maximizing \u03b7(\u03c0\u0304). The implementation is found explicitly in \"train_mask_network.py\" and the mask network model is in \"rice/explanation/mask_network.py\".\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1. The submission implements the required objective for the MuJoCo experiments by using a loss function \u2013(reward + bonus) during mask network training, which is effectively maximizing \u03b7(\u03c0\u0304) as specified in section 3.3.

It uses an MLP with ReLU activations to output a probability (via sigmoid) for the state being \u201cmasked\u201d (i.e., flagged as important) \u2013 which aligns with the \u201cOurs\u201d variant of StateMask.\n\u2022 The training of this mask network is implemented in rice/explanation/train_mask_network.py. It includes reward shaping (adding an alpha bonus when a mask/blind is used) and a loop that adjusts the mask network parameters. Although it uses a simplistic optimizer update rather than a full PPO update, it fulfills the requirement of transforming the objective as described in the paper.\n\u2022 The file rice/refining/rice_refiner.py contains the retraining pipeline. It defines a MixedInitEnv wrapper that uses the mask network to select the critical state along a trajectory, thereby allowing the retraining process to start from states chosen based on the explanation. The mask network (mask_net) is passed as an argument to the function run_rice_refining, showing that the \"Ours\" explanation method is indeed selectable and integrated into retraining.\n\u2022 In rice/experiments/table1_runner.py, the explanation training and subsequent refinement steps are hinted at, showing how the mask network is to be used during retraining.\nThese components together demonstrate that the submission provides a complete and selectable implementation of the \u201cOurs\u201d version of StateMask for the MuJoCo environments.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1  \nThe submission meets the criterion because it includes a correct implementation of the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method.

In the code, this should be evident in the mask network module (likely using a sigmoid output for probability) and in the training/inference logic where the binary decision is applied. I will specifically look for code that thresholds the mask network\u2019s output (e.g., comparing to 0.5) so that if the mask produces 0 (i.e., low probability to blind), the agent\u2019s original action is used, and if it produces 1, the action is replaced with a random sample. Although the criterion mentions the selfish mining environment, the implementation appears to be generic and should work across all environments including selfish mining.\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the submission, I found relevant code in the following files:\n- In \u201crice/explanation/mask_network.py\u201d, the MaskNetwork class is implemented. It builds a multilayer perceptron with a final sigmoid activation, which outputs a probability. The comment indicates that this is \u201cthe probability of 'blind' (1)\u201d. This suggests that a higher output (closer to 1) corresponds to the decision to blind the agent.\n- In \u201crice/explanation/train_mask_network.py\u201d, during training the mask network the code converts the network\u2019s probability output to a binary decision using a threshold (mask_action = (mask_prob > 0.5).float()). Then,\u202fthe code checks: \u201cif mask_action.item() == 1: action = env.action_space.sample()\u201d. This directs the program to replace the target policy\u2019s action with a random action if the mask outputs 1, which implies that for critical steps (where the target policy\u2019s action should be used) the mask network should ideally output 0.\n- This design exactly matches the requirement: it treats steps for which the mask network outputs 0 as critical (no blinding, so the agent\u2019s own action is used) and steps for which it outputs 1 as non-critical (blinding applied, i.e., replace with a random action).\n- Although the submission does not include a separate specific implementation file for the selfish mining environment (instead it provides a generic implementation used across environments), the generic implementation fulfills the criterion for selfish mining as well.\n\n# Score\nI award a score of 1 because the code correctly implements a mask network that outputs 0 for critical steps and 1 for non-critical steps (i.e., triggers random action replacement) exactly as required for the selfish mining environment explanation method.",

In practice, this would appear in the code that trains the mask network (following Algorithm 1 in the paper and section 3.3) by ensuring that instead of minimizing a loss that resembles a policy gradient objective based on, say, a surrogate loss (or by indirectly optimizing a negative loss), the code is set up to perform gradient ascent on the reward\u2014effectively replacing the classic objective with one that is equivalent to maximizing \u03b7(\ud835\udf0b\u0304). For the selfish mining environment in particular, I would expect to see either a branch or clear comments/documentation indicating that this objective transformation is applied when running in that environment, and that the update step for the mask network uses this \u201cmaximization of expected reward\u201d formulation.

The comment preceding this line (\"# Reward shaping: add alpha bonus when mask/blind is used\") confirms that the intent is to provide extra reward when the mask outputs \"1\".

Concretely, I would look for:\n\u2013 A module implementing the mask network (e.g. in \u201cmask_network.py\u201d),\n\u2013 A training script (e.g. \u201ctrain_mask_network.py\u201d) that uses the bonus (via an alpha hyperparameter) to adjust the loss as described,\n\u2013 Integration in the RICE retraining pipeline (e.g. in \u201crice_refiner.py\u201d) where the mask network is used to pick critical states,\n\u2013 Documentation or code comments indicating that this version (\u201cOurs\u201d) of the explanation method is available and selectable (especially for the selfish mining environment).\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission the following files are relevant:\n\u2022 The file \u201crice/explanation/mask_network.py\u201d defines a mask network that takes a state and outputs a probability (via a sigmoid) of \u201cmask/blind\u201d \u2013 this aligns with what is expected.\n\u2022 The file \u201crice/explanation/train_mask_network.py\u201d trains this mask network. In its implementation the code takes the target policy\u2019s action, substitutes a random action when the mask indicates \u201c1\u201d, and uses a reward bonus (reward + alpha * mask_action). Although the training loop is a simple gradient-descent update (rather than an explicit PPO loop), it does incorporate the additional bonus described in the paper. The README and comments indicate that this implementation represents the \u201cOurs\u201d optimized StateMask method.\n\u2022 The file \u201crice/refining/rice_refiner.py\u201d (the RICE refining module) accepts a mask network as a parameter and uses it to extract critical states in a trajectory \u2013 in particular, it computes importance scores (by calling the mask_net on states) and selects the state with the maximum score. This shows that during retraining the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method is used to direct the roll-in.\n\u2022 The README mentions that this repository provides a \u201cfull implementation\u201d of the RICE method and that it supports running experiments (including those for selfish mining, as noted in preceding criteria). However, the list of environments in \u201ctrain_pretrained_agents.py\u201d currently only includes MuJoCo environments; there is no dedicated selfish mining environment file. Nonetheless, the implementation of the mask network and its training is generic and can be used with any compatible gym environment. There is no explicit \u201cswitch\u201d in the code solely for selfish mining, but the integration of the mask network in the retraining pipeline means that if one uses a selfish mining environment, the \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method would be used.\nOverall, the core code for the \u201cOurs\u201d version of StateMask is present and is selectable during retraining (via passing in the trained mask network). Although the update for the mask network does not use an explicit PPO routine, the reward bonus and integration are in place as per the paper\u2019s description.\n\n# Score\nI award a score of 1. The submission includes the implementation of the optimized (\u201cOurs\u201d) StateMask explanation method (mask_network.py and train_mask_network.py) and integrates it into the retraining pipeline (rice_refiner.py). Even though there is no environment\u2010specific code for selfish mining, the generic implementation clearly supports using the \u201cOurs\u201d method during retraining, so the criterion is met.",

This class implements an MLP that ends with a linear layer followed by a sigmoid activation, outputting values in [0, 1]. The docstring explicitly states that the output is the probability of \"blind\" (mask value 1) \u2013 meaning that if the network outputs a high value (close to 1), the step is considered non-critical (i.e., the agent\u2019s action should be replaced), while a low value (close to 0) indicates that the step is critical.\n  \nLooking further, the file \"rice/explanation/train_mask_network.py\" demonstrates how the mask network is trained. In this script, after obtaining the mask probability from the network, the code thresholds it using:\n  \n\u2003\u2003mask_action = (mask_prob > 0.5).float()\n  \nThen, it checks if mask_action equals 1; if so, it replaces the target policy\u2019s action with a random sample from the environment\u2019s action space. This indicates that when the mask network outputs a value that rounds to 1 (i.e., non-critical), the agent\u2019s decision is overridden. Conversely, if the output is 0, the target agent\u2019s action is preserved\u2014thus meeting the requirement that critical steps yield an output of \u201c0.\u201d\n\nWhile reviewing \"rice/refining/rice_refiner.py\", I noted that the mask network is used to select a \"critical state\" from a sampled trajectory by computing the network\u2019s output over each state and then using np.argmax to select the state index. Given that \u201ccritical\u201d steps are supposed to have an output of 0 (which is lower than 1), this choice is potentially contradictory. However, since our criterion focuses specifically on the explanation method implementation (i.e., the mask network's output behavior) and not on how its output is used later in the refinement procedure, I will judge primarily the mask network and its training code.\n\nThere is no environment-specific code dedicated solely to the autonomous driving setup; the implementation appears generic. Nevertheless, it is intended to be used for all environments (including autonomous driving), and its design meets the required logic.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1\n\nThe submitted code correctly implements a mask network whose output is thresholded so that critical steps receive a \u201c0\u201d (indicating no intervention) and non-critical steps receive a \u201c1\u201d (triggering a random action), which aligns with the criterion. Despite a potential inconsistency in the refinement code (using np.argmax instead of np.argmin when selecting a critical state), the explanation module itself satisfies the requirement as stated for the autonomous driving environment.",

Therefore, in the correct reproduction we would expect to see code that (at least in the autonomous driving setting) explicitly incorporates a dual optimization step. Such code would likely compute a Lagrange multiplier or dual variable, update it alongside updating the mask network parameters, and implement an update rule following the principles of primal-dual optimization. It should not be a plain gradient descent update on a simple scalar reward, but instead reflect the structure of a constrained or dual-formulated optimization problem as required by the paper.\n\n# Reality  \nReviewing the submission we observe that the mask network is implemented in the file \u201crice/explanation/mask_network.py\u201d as a standard multi-layer perceptron with a sigmoid output.

In our review we would look for an implementation where the loss is defined in a way that is differentiable with respect to \u03b8 (for example using a stochastic sampling method or a log-probability based policy gradient) and that clearly is trying to maximize the overall cumulative reward of the perturbed agent.\n\n# Reality  \nThe submission includes code for the mask network and its training in the file \u201crice/explanation/train_mask_network.py\u201d. In this file the following key steps can be seen:  \n\u2003\u2022 The mask network is called on the current state to produce \u201cmask_prob\u201d (a probability of blinding).  \n\u2003\u2022 A binary decision \u201cmask_action\u201d is derived by applying a threshold (mask_prob > 0.5).  \n\u2003\u2022 If the mask is \u201con\u201d (mask_action equals 1), the agent\u2019s action is replaced with a random one, and an extra bonus (\u03b1 multiplied by the mask flag) is added to the reward.  \n\u2003\u2022 Then, the loss is computed as \u201closs = -torch.tensor([reward_prime], requires_grad=True)\u201d, and the network is updated with a standard gradient descent step.  \n\nHowever, this implementation does not correctly propagate gradients from the mask network\u2019s output. First, the mask action is obtained via a hard threshold instead of a differentiable sample (e.g. using torch.bernoulli or by reparameterizing the binary decision). Second, the loss is constructed via a new torch.tensor wrapping the scalar \u201creward_prime\u201d rather than using the output of the mask network itself (or its log probability) so that gradients can flow back to the network parameters. Essentially, the code minimizes a constant (\u2013reward_prime) that does not link back to the mask network\u2019s output, and therefore does not correctly optimize J(\u03b8)=max \u03b7(\ud835\udf0b\u0304). Moreover, there is no explicit differentiation in the code for autonomous driving (the implementation is generic for any environment and does not show any special branch for an autonomous driving scenario), though the criterion pertains specifically to that environment. This indicates that the implementation does not fulfill the intended transformation of the objective as described in Section 3.3 for the autonomous driving environment.\n\n# Score  \n0. The submission\u2019s code for training the mask network fails to correctly implement a differentiable objective that maximizes the perturbed policy\u2019s reward (J(\u03b8)=max \u03b7(\ud835\udf0b\u0304)) as outlined in the paper for the autonomous driving environment. The loss construction does not permit gradients to flow back to the mask network, so the intended objective is not properly optimized.",

Although the file does not include a full command\u2010line argument parser, the design using a function parameter means that \u201calpha\u201d is mutable through external function calls; e.g., a user may import and call train_mask_network with a different alpha value. It is not hardcoded into the network but is parameterized, which meets the criterion that it be mutable. There is no environment-specific (autonomous driving) code per se, but since this function is part of the generic explanation method pipeline, it will be used for all environments including autonomous driving. The README also directs the user to use this script for training the mask network, making it clear that the \u03b1 bonus is configurable.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1. The submission provides a proper implementation where the additional reward bonus is scaled by a mutable hyperparameter \u201calpha\u201d in the function train_mask_network.

The procedure is:\n\u2022 Run the agent normally to record a trajectory and its original reward.\n\u2022 Use an explanation method (mask network) to compute importance scores for every step.\n\u2022 Use a sliding window to select the most critical consecutive segment (of length l, with l determined as a fraction of the full episode length L).\n\u2022 Reset the environment and run the episode again, but replace the actions within that critical segment by random actions.\n\u2022 Measure the absolute difference between the original reward and the reward after randomization. Also, record the maximum possible reward change.\n\u2022 Finally, compute a fidelity score by taking the logarithm of the ratio of the average reward change to the maximum reward change and adjusting by a term related to l and L.\nI expect to see code that implements these steps, likely in a dedicated file (e.g., a \"fidelity_score.py\"), and the code should be generic enough to work with the network defence environment if provided.

For timesteps before the critical segment, it uses the agent\u2019s normal policy; for timesteps during the critical segment (from start_idx to start_idx+l), it forces a random action using env.action_space.sample(); and after the segment, it returns to using the normal policy.\n\u2022 It computes the absolute difference between the original reward and the reward from the modified rollout, aggregates these differences across episodes, and uses the maximum original reward as a proxy for the maximum reward change.\n\u2022 Finally, it computes the fidelity score using the formula: log(d_mean/(d_max + eps)) \u2013 log(l/L).\n\nThis exactly reflects the procedure described in the paper\u2019s section 4.1/4.2 and the addendum.

In code, I expect to see a distinct branch or mechanism (or a configurable option) that, when activated, causes the agent to be restarted solely from the critical states rather than using a mixed-initial distribution. Specifically, I would look for code (e.g. in the environment reset logic or a dedicated script) that identifies the critical state from a trajectory using the mask network and then resets the environment to that state before resuming fine-tuning. Furthermore, this implementation should match the description in Section 4.1 of the paper (and per Cheng et al., 2023) where the baseline \u201cStateMask-R\u201d is characterized by resetting solely to the identified critical state without further exploration bonuses.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, the file \u201crice/refining/rice_refiner.py\u201d contains a MixedInitEnv wrapper. In its reset method, it uses the mask network to roll out a trajectory, computes importance scores for each state, and then selects the state with the maximum importance (i.e. the identified critical state) if a random condition determined by parameter p is met. If p is set equal to 1, then every reset would use the critical state, effectively performing a StateMask-R style fine-tuning. However, the implementation is part of the overall RICE algorithm which additionally wraps the environment with an RNDWrapper to include an exploration bonus and uses a mixed-initial distribution when p\u2009<\u20091.\nFurthermore, the README and \u201ctable1_runner.py\u201d comments mention refining using \u201cRICE (ours)\u201d while also referring in comments to different methods including \u201cStateMask-R\u201d. However, there is no separate, stand-alone implementation or explicit switch solely for StateMask-R. The available code does not provide a distinct implementation solely corresponding to StateMask-R; rather, it provides the RICE method and relies on the p parameter (and lambda_rnd) for mixing, which means one could set p=1 and lambda_rnd=0 to approximate StateMask-R. There is no dedicated code or documentation clearly indicating that the baseline StateMask fine-tuning as described in Section 4.1 has been reproduced independently.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0  \nWhile the submission does implement a mechanism in MixedInitEnv for resetting to a critical state based on the mask network, this code is embedded within the overall RICE algorithm and does not provide a separate or clearly delineated implementation of StateMask fine-tuning (StateMask-R) as a baseline. Without an explicit implementation or configuration (e.g. a distinct module or clear instructions to set p=1 and remove the RND bonus) that reproduces the StateMask-R baseline as described in the paper and Cheng et al. (2023), the criterion is not met.",

We expect to see explicit code (for example a custom environment wrapper) that, in its reset() method, probabilistically decides between using a trajectory-derived \u201ccritical state\u201d (based on the highest importance score from the mask network) and the environment's regular reset state.\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, the file \"rice/refining/rice_refiner.py\" contains a class called MixedInitEnv that wraps the environment.

In the paper (and in Cheng et al., 2023) this procedure is distinguished from the full RICE method by not using a mixed initial state; rather, when running StateMask\u2011R the agent always resets to the critical state as identified by the explanation method. In code, I would expect to see an environment wrapper or a training script specific to the network defence environment that uses this \u201creset-to-critical-state\u201d logic. This might be realized with a flag or by setting the mixing parameter p to 1.

This mechanism does implement \u201creset-to-critical-state\u201d behavior when p is set to 1\u2014that is, it becomes equivalent to the StateMask\u2011R method as outlined in the paper. However, the submission does not contain any network defence environment\u2013specific code; in fact, \"rice/envs/train_pretrained_agents.py\" only lists MuJoCo environments (Hopper, Walker2d, Reacher, HalfCheetah). There is no separate implementation or configuration targeting a network defence environment. As a result, while the mixed initialization mechanism (which can mimic StateMask\u2011R if configured appropriately) is implemented generically in rice_refiner.py, there is no actual evidence that the authors have implemented and run the \"StateMask-R\" fine-tuning baseline for the network defence environment as required.  \n\n# Score  \n0 \u2013 The submission does not demonstrate a dedicated implementation of StateMask fine\u2011tuning (\"StateMask-R\") for the network defence environment.

This bonus is added to the task reward, and its contribution is controlled by a hyperparameter, \u03bb (or an acceptable alternative name), which scales the intrinsic exploration bonus. I expect to see the refining code take a parameter (e.g., named \u201clambda_rnd\u201d or similar) that is used to multiply the difference between a target network and a predictor network (i.e., the intrinsic reward). This \u03bb value should be easily configurable, for example as a parameter passed into the refining function without requiring code modification, and there should be an accompanying script (or similar mechanism) that demonstrates its mutability (such as a sweep over different values). Additionally, I would look for this functionality to be integrated into the RND wrapper that adds the bonus to the task reward.\n\n# Reality\nIn the provided submission:\n- The file \u201crice/refining/rice_refiner.py\u201d defines a function called run_rice_refining that accepts a parameter named \u201clambda_rnd\u201d (with a default value of 0.01). This parameter is then passed to the RNDWrapper class.\n- Within RNDWrapper (inside the same file), the __init__ method accepts lambda_rnd and stores it as self.lambda_rnd. In the reward() method, we see the line:\n  \n  reward = reward + self.lambda_rnd * intrinsic\n  \n  which correctly implements the trade-off by scaling the intrinsic (exploration) reward with lambda_rnd.\n- The hyperparameter is also shown to be mutable. For instance, the file \u201cscripts/hyperparam_sweep.py\u201d defines a function sweep_lambda that iterates over a list of different \u03bb values (0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001) and calls run_rice_refining with these values. This confirms that the \u03bb hyperparameter can be changed without directly editing the main code.\n- Although the criterion specifies the \u201cnetwork defence environment,\u201d the implementation of the refining method (with lambda_rnd controlling the exploration bonus) is generic and is intended to work across environments. This is acceptable per the addendum, as long as the functionality (i.e., lambda controlling the bonus) is present.\n\n# Score\nScore: 1\n\nThe submission meets the criterion because it correctly implements a mutable hyperparameter (named lambda_rnd) in the refining method that scales the exploration bonus, and this value is configurable through function parameters and hyperparameter sweep scripts without the need to modify code directly.",

I would look for code that, in the context of autonomous driving, sets up a PPO agent (ideally using a lowered learning rate compared to the pre-training phase) and further trains (fine-tunes) it on the autonomous driving environment. Ideally, this would be in a dedicated script or function (or as a branch in an experiment runner) clearly separate from the RICE refinement method. I also expect that the autonomous driving environment is distinctly referenced, and the fine-tuning code would demonstrate a simple continuation of PPO training with modified hyperparameters (e.g., a lower learning rate).\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the provided submission files, I observed the following:\n- The submission contains files for pre-training agents (in \u201crice/envs/train_pretrained_agents.py\u201d), training the mask network (in \u201crice/explanation/train_mask_network.py\u201d), computing fidelity scores (\u201crice/explanation/fidelity_score.py\u201d), and the main RICE refinement implementation (\u201crice/refining/rice_refiner.py\u201d).\n- The file \u201crice/refining/rice_refiner.py\u201d shows a function `run_rice_refining` that implements the core logic of the RICE method via mixing initial states (via a \u201cMixedInitEnv\u201d) and applying an intrinsic reward through a simplified RND wrapper. This function employs PPO (from Stable Baselines3) to continue training.\n- However, I did not find evidence that the submission includes a specific implementation of the PPO fine-tuning baseline that is distinct from the RICE method.

If so, it rolls out a trajectory, evaluates each state using the provided mask_net (i.e. by computing importance scores), and selects the state corresponding to the maximum importance score to reset the environment. This behavior is exactly what is expected: when p is set to 1, the environment will always reset to a critical state as determined by the mask network\u2014i.e., it will execute the \"StateMask-R\" baseline using the optimized mask network.\n\u2022 The parameter sweep script (scripts/hyperparam_sweep.py) includes a function sweep_p that iterates over p values including 1, thus allowing one to test the StateMask-R variant (p=1) with the optimized mask network.\n\u2022 The README clearly indicates that the explanation network (trained via train_mask_network.py) and the refining method (via rice_refiner.py) are employed in the experiments.\n\nThese pieces of code demonstrate that when the refinement method is set to be StateMask-R (for example, by setting p=1), the optimized mask network (\"Ours\") is indeed the explanation used.\n\n# Score\nI give a score of 1.

In concrete terms, I expect the refinement pipeline (especially the environment reset or critical state selection component) to call into a trained mask network (the optimized StateMask variant, implemented in files like mask_network.py and trained via train_mask_network.py) to determine when and where to reset the environment. The code should show that when running the PPO\u2010based fine-tuning refinement (Experiment II), the reset logic of the environment uses the mask network\u2019s outputs (importance scores) to decide on a critical state for initializing the rollout. I will look for code in the refining pipeline (e.g. in rice_refiner.py and potentially in an experiment runner like table1_runner.py) that passes a \u201cmask_net\u201d into the refinement method and uses its output to influence the reset procedure, indicating that \u201cOurs\u201d is indeed being used.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission contains a file named rice/refining/rice_refiner.py which defines the function run_rice_refining. In this function, a custom wrapper class called MixedInitEnv is implemented. In its reset() method, a trajectory is rolled out using the pretrained agent and then the code computes importance scores via:\n\u2003\u2003imps = [self.mask_net(torch.tensor(s, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)).item() for s, _, _ in traj]\nand then selects the state with the maximum importance (via np.argmax on imps) to initiate the next episode. This clearly shows that the mask network (the optimized StateMask \u201cOurs\u201d explanation method from rice/explanation/mask_network.py and trained using train_mask_network.py) is being used to identify critical states.\nAdditionally, the README.md and table1_runner.py (even though commented out) indicate that the pipeline for refinement involves pretraining an agent, training a mask network, and then refining using run_rice_refining where the mask network is passed in. There is no separate handling of different explanation methods; instead the optimized explanation method (\u201cOurs\u201d) is the one integrated into the RICE refinement pipeline. This matches our expectation for the PPO fine-tuning baseline in Experiment II to use \u201cOurs.\u201d\n\n# Score\n1 \u2013 The submission meets the criterion. The code in rice/refining/rice_refiner.py explicitly integrates the mask network (the optimized StateMask \"Ours\" explanation method) into the environment reset logic for refinement, thereby ensuring that even the PPO fine-tuning baseline is run using the optimized explanation method.

It includes a comment \u201cEval reward: collect over final episodes, repeat for each method and random seed\u201d but does not contain explicit code that records or logs cumulative reward throughout the refinement process.\n- The hyperparameter sweep scripts (`scripts/hyperparam_sweep.py`) do include loops that run refinement and then compute a reward per episode (summing rewards in a loop per trial) and print out mean and std values.

In practice, I would look for code that, during the refinement phase (for example inside the PPO training loop or a dedicated evaluation phase during training), accumulates the rewards from environment rollout and either prints, logs, or otherwise outputs those cumulative rewards across episodes or timesteps. This code should be specifically present in the context of the selfish mining environment (even if similar in structure to the MuJoCo cases) and for the PPO fine-tuning baseline, so that Experiment II\u2019s cumulative reward metric can be reported.\n\n# Reality\nReviewing the files provided, the core refinement logic is located in \u201crice/refining/rice_refiner.py\u201d. In this file, the function run_rice_refining wraps the environment with a mixed initial state wrapper and an RND exploration wrapper and then calls PPO\u2019s learn() to perform refinement.

In these loops, cumulative reward per episode is computed (by summing up rewards in a while-loop until episode termination) and then the mean and standard deviation are calculated and printed. While this does measure the final performance (i.e., the episodic cumulative reward after refinement), it is executed in a generic evaluation loop and is not tailored specifically nor clearly labeled for the selfish mining environment or as part of the \u201cPPO fine-tuning\u201d baseline.\n\nThere is also a placeholder experimental runner (\u201crice/experiments/table1_runner.py\u201d) that contains commented-out instructions for evaluating rewards and logging final performance, but it does not actually implement real-time or throughout-refinement cumulative reward tracking.

In other words, there should be a mechanism (such as a callback, logging loop, or evaluation schedule) that periodically sums up and logs the episodic rewards as the agent is refined. This code should be specific to the \u201cPPO fine-tuning\u201d method (which, in the RICE paper, is a baseline where the agent\u2019s refinement is simply continued training using PPO) and would likely involve running evaluation episodes (accumulating the rewards per episode) at various points during the refinement process. I would look for a loop or a callback that computes and saves the cumulative reward (often a sum over an episode) over the refinement process, especially for the network defence environment (or a placeholder representing that environment).\n\n# Reality\nIn the submission, the network defence environment is not explicitly named but is one of the several environments the reproduction supports (the code covers, for example, Hopper, Walker2d, etc.). However, the candidate\u2019s code is organized generically so that the same evaluation code can be applied to any environment, including one for network defence. In the provided files:\n- The \u201crice/refining/rice_refiner.py\u201d file implements the core RICE algorithm and wraps the environment with a \u201cMixedInitEnv\u201d and \u201cRNDWrapper\u201d. However, this file does not contain any code that actively logs or records the cumulative reward during the refinement training process; it simply calls PPO\u2019s learn() method.\n- In \u201cscripts/hyperparam_sweep.py\u201d, there are loops that, after a full refining run (via run_rice_refining), run an evaluation loop. In these loops, the code resets the environment, steps through an episode, and accumulates the reward in a variable \u201cep_reward\u201d. The mean and standard deviation over several episodes are computed and printed. This evaluation, however, is done only after a refinement run is complete rather than \u201cthroughout\u201d the refinement process.\n- The \u201crice/experiments/table1_runner.py\u201d file (the experiment runner) outlines a pipeline including pre-training, training the mask network, fidelity evaluation, and then refinement with RICE and other methods. Although it mentions logging final reward per approach, the code is mostly placeholder/commented out and does not show any functionality that continuously logs cumulative rewards during the refinement process.\nThus, while there is code that calculates a cumulative reward (by summing rewards per episode) after training is finished (or in a parameter sweep run), there is no explicit mechanism implemented that measures and logs the cumulative reward \u201cthroughout\u201d the refinement process for the PPO fine\u2010tuning method (or its baseline version) in the network defence environment.\n\n# Score\n0 \u2013 The submission does not provide an explicit implementation for monitoring cumulative reward throughout the refinement process (i.e. during training) in the context described.

In the refining module (\u201crice/refining/rice_refiner.py\u201d), the code wraps the environment in a MixedInitEnv. Inside the reset() method of this wrapper, the code runs a trajectory with the pre-trained agent, computes importance scores for each state using the trained mask network (by calling self.mask_net on each state), and selects the state with maximum importance to reset the environment. This integration indicates that the optimized state mask explanation method is being used to determine the critical state for the RICE refinement.

In other words, there should be a segment of code (or a branch within an experiment runner) that, when running the StateMask-R refinement method on the autonomous driving environment, explicitly accumulates episode rewards during the refinement phase and outputs or logs these cumulative rewards (possibly for plotting or reporting as in Table 1/Figure 2). I would look for clear logging or aggregation of cumulative reward values across refinement iterations (or episodes) and a clear distinction in the code between the methods \u201cRICE (ours)\u201d and the \u201cStateMask-R\u201d baseline.

This file implements a function called run_rice_refining, which encapsulates the RICE method as described in the paper (mixing initial states with RND exploration and PPO fine-tuning). There is no conditional branch or separate implementation for the baseline \"StateMask-R\" refinement method.\n\u2022 In \"rice/experiments/table1_runner.py\", there is a comment describing that the pipeline should refine the agent using multiple methods, including \"PPO fine-tuning, StateMask-R, RICE (ours), JSRL\", however the actual code only calls run_rice_refining (presumably representing the RICE method) and contains no separate code branch for \"StateMask-R.\"\n\u2022 Moreover, \"scripts/hyperparam_sweep.py\" includes functions (sweep_lambda and sweep_p) that run the refinement and then evaluate the refined agent by running episodes in a loop to obtain a cumulative reward. However, these functions call run_rice_refining (i.e., the RICE method) and do not distinguish any special handling or logging for a StateMask-R method.\n\u2022 There is no explicit mention or branch in any file that identifies the method as \"StateMask-R,\" nor is there any code that specifically measures and logs cumulative reward continuously during the refinement process for the autonomous driving environment under the StateMask-R method.\n\nThus, while the submission includes generic cumulative reward evaluation (e.g., in hyperparam_sweep.py the refined agent\u2019s performance is judged by averaging episodic rewards) this evaluation is only used after running run_rice_refining and does not appear to be implemented specifically for the StateMask-R baseline in the autonomous driving environment.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0\n\nThere is no clear, separate implementation for the \"StateMask-R\" refinement method in the autonomous driving environment, nor is there explicit code that measures cumulative reward throughout a refinement process specific to that baseline.

In practice, this would involve instrumenting the refinement procedure (likely after invoking PPO learning) with a loop over episodes where the agent\u2019s actions are executed, rewards are summed (i.e., an \"ep_reward\" variable is accumulated), and the final cumulative reward is recorded and logged. I would expect these measurements to be reported (or at least available) in the experiment runner or a similar testing script dedicated to the autonomous driving environment\u2019s refinement method.\n\n# Reality\nExamining the provided files:\n- In the \u201cscripts/hyperparam_sweep.py\u201d file, there are functions named sweep_lambda() and sweep_p() that run a refinement run (via the function run_rice_refining) and then loop over a fixed number of episodes where the environment is reset, a while-loop accumulates rewards in an \u201cep_reward\u201d variable, and the final cumulative rewards are then averaged and logged. This is a standard mechanism for measuring cumulative reward, although it is implemented in a generic hyperparameter sweep context.\n- However, the criterion specifically requires that this cumulative reward measurement is implemented for Experiment II in the autonomous driving environment, and specifically for the \u201cPPO fine-tuning\u201d baseline refinement method. In the provided submission, the experiment runner \u201crice/experiments/table1_runner.py\u201d acts only as a placeholder with comment instructions\u2014it is not fully implemented and does not include any distinct or explicit code for the PPO fine-tuning refinement method in the autonomous driving environment.\n- Moreover, there is no file or code segment that explicitly indicates that the autonomous driving environment is being used for the PPO fine-tuning refinement method, nor is there evidence of cumulative reward being measured \u201cthroughout refinement\u201d for that specific case. The code in hyperparam_sweep.py is generic and appears designed for the RICE (ours) refinement (using run_rice_refining), not the separate PPO fine-tuning baseline.\n  \n# Score\nScore: 0\n\nExplanation: Although there is code in hyperparam_sweep.py that measures cumulative reward via an episodic loop, this code is generic and not clearly tied to a PPO fine-tuning refinement method in the autonomous driving environment. There is no distinct implementation or runner in the submission that explicitly does cumulative reward measurement for the PPO fine-tuning baseline on autonomous driving, as required by the criterion. Therefore, the criterion is not met.",

For example, the file \u201crice/envs/train_pretrained_agents.py\u201d lists only MuJoCo environments (Hopper-v4, Walker2d-v4, Reacher-v4, HalfCheetah-v4) and does not include any network defence environment. The experiment runner \u201crice/experiments/table1_runner.py\u201d and the hyperparameter sweep scripts (\u201cscripts/hyperparam_sweep.py\u201d) contain generic loops for collecting episodic rewards, where each evaluation run resets the environment and sums rewards until termination. However, none of these files specify or reference a network defence environment. There is no module or configuration file for a network defence environment, and no branch appears to select a \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method specifically applied to that environment. The cumulative reward measurement that I see (for instance, in \u201cscripts/hyperparam_sweep.py\u201d) is implemented generically; however, it is not set up or demonstrated in the context of the network defence environment with the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method as required by the criterion.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0  \nThe submission fails to provide a network defence environment setup and does not include any specialized code for measuring cumulative reward during refinement for the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method in that environment. While there is generic cumulative reward measurement code in the hyperparameter sweeps, there is no evidence that the network defence environment is supported or that the required measurement has been implemented for that environment with the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method.",

However, I did not find any file or code that is specific to the autonomous driving environment; for example, the environments in \"rice/envs/train_pretrained_agents.py\" list only MuJoCo environments (Hopper, Walker2d, Reacher, HalfCheetah).\n\nMoreover, while the code does implement evaluating cumulative reward (e.g., in \"sweep_lambda\" and \"sweep_p\" in \"scripts/hyperparam_sweep.py\", where it resets the environment and accumulates rewards over an episode), it does not explicitly branch on or mention an autonomous driving environment. Also, the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method baseline is not separately implemented \u2013 there is no separate module for a random explanation, such as a version of the mask network that returns random values. Consequently, while the code does have evaluation loops that measure cumulative reward during refinement, these are generic; there is no distinction made specifically for the autonomous driving environment under the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method.\n\n# Score\nScore: 0\n\nExplanation: Although there is code for collecting cumulative rewards during refinement (as seen in the hyperparameter sweep scripts), there is no evidence in the submission of a dedicated implementation for the autonomous driving environment under the \u201cRandom\u201d explanation method. The necessary distinctions (selecting \u201cRandom\u201d as the explanation method, or specific handling for the autonomous driving environment) are missing. Therefore, the criterion is not met.",

An \u201calpha\u201d bonus is applied to the reward in such cases. This follows the paper\u2019s description.\n\u2022 In rice/refining/rice_refiner.py, within the MixedInitEnv wrapper\u2019s reset method, the code performs a rollout (collecting a trajectory), then it computes:\n\u2003\u2003imps = [self.mask_net(torch.tensor(s, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)).item() for s, _, _ in traj]\nIt then selects the index with the maximum importance score (using np.argmax) to determine the critical state.

For example, during pretraining the code should either wrap the environment with a monitoring tool (or use built\u2010in logging from the RL library) so that average rewards over episodes are recorded, and during refinement there should be code that steps through episodes, accumulates rewards, and then computes statistics (like mean and standard deviation). In particular, I expect utility functions or loops (e.g., in evaluation or hyperparameter sweep scripts) that reset the environment, run the agent for a full episode, sum up rewards, and then log these values for later plotting or comparison.\n\n# Reality\nThe submission includes several files that implement reward measurement:\n- In the file \u201cscripts/hyperparam_sweep.py\u201d, functions \u201csweep_lambda\u201d and \u201csweep_p\u201d run a loop that resets the environment, executes the refined agent for an episode, and accumulates rewards (using a loop where \u201cep_reward\u201d is summed until termination). These functions then compute the mean and standard deviation of the rewards over a fixed number of test runs and print out these measurements.\n- The file \u201crice/explanation/fidelity_score.py\u201d shows a function \u201ccompute_fidelity_score\u201d that runs the agent normally, accumulates the total episode reward (reward_orig), then runs a second rollout with controlled randomization and measures the difference in reward. This confirms that rewards are being measured and used in a computed metric.\n- In \u201crice/experiments/table1_runner.py\u201d, although most of the code is commented out, there are explicit comments indicating that the final reward for each method is being logged and that the code is designed to collect reward statistics (mean, std) across seed runs.\n- The pretraining file (\u201crice/envs/train_pretrained_agents.py\u201d) calls agent.learn() on each environment, which by default (with Stable Baselines3 and the Monitor wrapper, if used) tracks rewards. Although it doesn\u2019t explicitly print reward logs in custom code, it relies on the PPO training\u2019s verbose output and saving of policies. Given our addendum\u2019s instructions that trends rather than exact numbers are important, this is acceptable.\n\nOverall, the provided code in multiple scripts does include loops and functions that measure and log rewards during both the agent\u2019s pretraining (via the training script and PPO\u2019s built\u2010in logging) and during refinement (explicit reward accumulation loops and hyperparameter sweeps).\n\n# Score\nScore: 1\n\nThe submission successfully implements code for measuring reward throughout both pretraining and refinement. Functions in \u201cscripts/hyperparam_sweep.py\u201d and \u201cfidelity_score.py\u201d clearly accumulate episode rewards and compute performance statistics. Even though some of the reward measurement in the pretraining phase is delegated to Stable Baselines3\u2019s built\u2010in mechanisms, the overall solution meets the criterion.",
